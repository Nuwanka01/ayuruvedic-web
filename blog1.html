                    Verily Yoga is not possible for him who eats too much, or who does not eat at all, who sleeps too much, or who is always awake. <br>
                    Yoga becomes the destroyer of pain for him who is moderate in eating and recreation, which is moderate in exertion in actions, which is moderate in sleep and wakefulness. (Bagawath Gheetha)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <b>"The eating practices of most people are matters of habit and custom, rather than of intelligent planning. Our people are influenced more in their eating by advertising than they are by any knowledge of foods. They eat what has been made to taste good, rather than what is truly good. They eat foods which they know contain poisons- chemical preservatives, coal tar dyes, artificial flavourings,etc-with no thought of these poisons, and reject good foods only because they have not learned to eat them. Seasonings, rather than flavors of foods, determine what is liked by their undiscriminating tastes."</b>(Dr Herbert M.Shelton.)

                    <b>"Eat always from the table of God; the fruits of the trees, the grains and grasses of the field, the milk of beasts, and the honey of bees. For everything beyond these is Satan, and leads by the way of sins and diseases unto death. But the foods which you eat from the abundant table of God fed Methuselah of old, and I tell you truly, if you live even as he lived, then will the God of the living give you also long life upon the earth as was his."</b> (Words of Jesus from the Essence Gospel of Peace)

                    <h2><b>What do you think of when you hear the words “Ayurveda Wellbeing Foodstuffs"? </h2></b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Mashed potatoes and gravy at Thanksgiving, ice-cream in the middle of the night or cream donuts for breakfast? That may be what you crave, but these foods won't comfort you very long; in fact, they may even cause discomfort in your digestion. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2><b>
                    How about a warm soup or rice pudding? 
                    </h2></b>
                    <p>
                    Real comfort foods are nutritious, nurturing, wholesome and satisfying. According to Ayurveda, they should also be intelligent, and balance the mind and body.
                    Ingest nature's intelligence with your food</p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The food you eat should be lively. Fresh, organic, home-cooked food has the power to carry nature's intelligence to your brain and body. </li>
                    <li>These foods are called triptighna, which means they are satisfying and nourishing. Preserved, frozen, processed foods and leftovers, on the other hand, are triptighna: foods that leave your body unsatisfied and craving for more. </li>
                    <li>Since these junk foods are void of intelligence they cannot support the intelligence of the physiology, so you end up eating more and craving for more without ever getting nourished or fulfilled. What's more, you can easily gain weight this way. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2> Cooked food versus raw food</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>While we want to preserve the intelligence of our ingredients, we also want to make them digestible. </li>
                    <li>That's where cooking comes in, which inserts agni, digestive fire, in our food so we can digest and assimilate it properly. </li>
                    <li>Certain food items, such us grains, beans and dahls should always be eaten cooked. </li>
                    <li>Most vegetables are also more beneficial cooked, and some of them, such as spinach, chard, kale, broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and cabbage, should never be eaten raw. </li>
                    <li>Milk is another item that can be hard to digest so ayurveda recommends always boiling it with some cardamom and cinnamon. </li>
                    <li>Make sure, however, not to overcook or burn anything. </li>
                    <li>Add some ghee or olive oil, water and spices to protect nature's intelligence. </li>
                    <li>You don't have to cook everything and skip salads entirely. </li>
                    <li>Juicy vegetables, such as cucumber and lettuces, can be refreshing for lunch in the summer but stay away from them at night and in the winter since they can aggravate Vata. </li>
                    <li>Also, if your digestive fire is weak, stay away from sprouts. </li>
                    <li>Fruits are also good raw during the day. </li>
                    <li>In the morning, a stewed apple is best to stimulate the digestive system. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Use spice-power</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <p>In addition to their delicious taste, spices can greatly increase the intelligence of your meals. </p> 
                    <p>They also help with digestion and assimilation. </p>
                    <p>To bring the most out of them, cook them with your food or sauté them in ghee and add them to your meals. </p>
                    <p>For best assimilation of the benefits of therapeutic spices, eat them cooked, instead of sprinkling raw spices over foods. </p>
                    <p>Ayurvedic spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon and cardamom offer rich and varied aroma and flavor besides helping to balance different doshas and enhancing the metabolism. </p>
                    <p>They can transform simple dishes into feasts for all your senses, providing fulfillment and contentment from meals. </p>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Stop the cravings</h2>
                    </p>
                      <p>The first thing you can do to avoid feelings of false hunger and cravings is to increase the intelligence in your meals by eating, fresh, home-made meals, and avoiding "junk" foods. You also need to eat a variety of foods with all six tastes. </p>
                    <p>Make sure to eat sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter and astringent foods to satisfy the body. </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Cooked food is also more nourishing than raw foods.</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>Raw foods are harder to digest and can diminish agni. </p>
                    <p>When agni is weak, the body creates ama (accumulated toxins), which clogs the channels and prevents the body from receiving nutrients from food. This, in the end, results in cravings. Ayurveda also encourages portion control. Eat enough but don't overeat. Your stomach should be two-thirds full after main meals.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Sweets for the heart</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Emotional downs are the result of an imbalance in Sadhaka Pitta, the subdosha that governs the heart. The sweet taste pacifies pitta, which explains our cravings for sweets. But before you reach for cookies or chocolate, think for a moment. Although these foods provide the sweet taste, they lack the intelligence to carry it to your brain, which won't register it and the craving won't stop. Try a piece of sweet, juicy fruit, soaked dates or raisins, rice pudding, milk-date shakes or mango shakes. These healthy foods will deliver to the brain and heart what they need and leave you satisfied.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Foods to pacify worries.</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Worries and mental imbalance are the result of aggravated Vata dosha. To calm the mind, eat easy-to-digest, nourishing meals and use spices such as black pepper, cumin and coriander to open the channels of the brain. </li>
                    <li>In addition to the above-mentioned sweets, walnuts, almonds and coconut milk are especially supportive for the mind. </li>
                    <li>These spices also help open up the channels of the mind, heart and the rest of the physiology. </li>
                    <li>Realizing that junk foods will not satisfy your body is the first step in beating the cravings. </li>
                    <li>With a little attention you can switch to healthier options and receive more nutrition, which will decrease your desire for unintelligent snacks. A well-nourished body is only hungry for healthy food! </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Ayurvedic Daily Diet (Ayurvedic Guidelines for Vata, Pitta and Kapha.)</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ayurveda recommends following a daily diet tailored being optimal for your individual physiology.</p> 
                    <p>An ayurvedic physician can recommend an individual diet after assessing your needs for balance. </p>
                    <p>However, there are some general food guidelines for balancing the three doshas -- Vata, Pitta and Kapha. Our detailed charts showing specific food dos and don'ts for balancing Vata, Pitta and Kapha can help you eat for balance.</p> 
                     <p>
                    <h2>Ayurveda sees nutrition as a choice based on an individual's unique tastes and imbalances. </h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>The logic is simple. We are all made differently. Our energies, moods, emotions, actions, and reactions are unique to us. Even in the same family, one person may love to eat Chinese food, while another could have absolutely no taste for it. Similarly, one person might not be able to tolerate cold weather, while another would be happy out skiing in February. </li>
                    <li>Now this obviously means that our bodies have an innate intelligence of their own, which decides what kind of clothing they need, what kind of food is suitable for them, what kind of activities they would like to pursue? </li>
                    <li>Quite simply, a healthy body is blessed with plenty of natural intelligence--you could also call it strong natural immunity--and will love what is good for it. But if there is an imbalance, then the body--or rather, the senses--will crave things that are harmful rather than healing to us. For example, a person prone to Pitta-related imbalances like skin eruptions should ideally avoid hot, spicy foods. But if that person's physiology is ridden with dosha imbalances, then he or she will not be able to resist eating spicy curries. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>An interesting observation about the American diet: "The typical American diet,"</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>"Under-represents the pungent, bitter, and astringent tastes, and overemphasizes the sweet taste, as well as the salty and sour. These three tastes increase Kapha dosha, which is part of how Ayurveda would explain the prevalence of obesity (a Kapha imbalance) in the West." </li>
                    <li>The best way to ensure you get a "complete" diet is to try and get all six flavors on your plate--sweet, salty, sour, bitter, pungent, and astringent. </li>
                    <li>Add flavor and healing nutrients to your food by cooking them with Ayurveda Churnas. Blended in precise proportions to ensure dosha balance, these spice-mixes are both delicious and versatile. </li>
                    <li>On the whole, the balance of tastes ideal for your individual constitution depends on your prakurthi or original combination of doshic energies, and vikurthi--the imbalances you are trying to correct at any point in time.

                    <h2>There are three kinds of food that a man can eat.
                    (Sattwic, Rajasic and Tamasic).</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>All foods have different properties. Different foods exercise different effects on different compartments of the brain or the mind.</li> 
                    <li>A confection of sparrow, meat, fish, eggs, onion and garlic excites passion. Fruits, barley, etc. render the mind calm and serene. </li>
                    <li>The nature of food greatly influences the being of a man. Man feels a desire for particular foods according to his guna or temperament. </li>
                    <li>The body is the instrument by which man accomplishes all his purposes in the world. It is the horse that takes him to his destination or goal (moksha or liberation). Therefore, it should be kept clean, strong and healthy. The body is a mould prepared by the mind for its activities. </li>
                    <li>There is an intimate connection between the body and the mind. The nature and condition of the body has a vital effect upon the mind and activities. Therefore, the materials or foods that build the body and the mind should be pure, wholesome, nutritious, substantial and bland. </li>
                    <li>Everything in this world is threefold. The food is Sattwic, Rajasic or Tamasic according to its character and effect upon the body and the mind. </li>
                    <li>You can find out the nature or temperament of a man from the nature of the food he takes. You can find out your own nature, whether you are Sattwic, Rajasic or Tamasic from your predilection to particular food and then abandon the Rajasic and the Tamasic foodstuffs and take to the Sattwic diet. </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Sattwic food</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Pure food increases the vitality and strength of those who eat it. It augments the energy of the mind also. Sattwic food produces cheerfulness, serenity and mental clarity and helps the aspirants to enter into deep meditation and maintain mental poise and nervous equilibrium. It supplies the maximum energy to the body and the mind. It is very easily assimilated and absorbed. </li>
                    <li>A Sattwic man relishes juicy food and other foods which are attractive in form, soft to touch and pleasant to taste, which are small in bulk but great in nourishment like the words from the lips of a spiritual preceptor. Sattwic food is highly conducive to health. </li>
                    <li>Eat that food which will develop Sattwa in you. Milk, butter, ghee, (clarified butter), fresh ripe fruits, almonds, dates, green dal, barley, wheat, cereals, tomatoes, plantains etc., are Sattwic. </li>
                    <li>Abandon fish, meat, liquors, eggs, etc., ruthlessly if you want to increase Sattwa and attain Self-realization. The mind is formed of the subtle portion of the food. "As is the food so is the mind"- says a Hindi proverb. If you take Sattwic food, the mind also will be Sattwic. The seven elements (dhatus) of the body (chyle, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow and semen) are formed out of food. </li>
                    <li>Ideas and concepts are generated in the mind corresponding to these seven elements. As is the constitution of these elements, so is the constitution of the mind. Just as water is rendered hot when the pot that contains it is placed over the fire, so also the nature and constitution of the mind is according to the nature and constitution of the food or the seven elements. </li>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Food of a passionate nature produces restlessness in the mind, evil thoughts, excitement, craving now for one and then for another, pain, trouble and disease. The Rajasic man always plans to prepare various kinds of preparations to satisfy his palate. He takes salt, chillies, mustard, cloves, condiments, pungent pickles etc., in excess. Tears flow from his eyes and water dribbles from his nose and yet he will not leave the hot and pungent articles. The palate remains unsatisfied until the stomach is completely filled with pungent things, till the tongue is burnt with chillis. Ladies’ fingers (an Indian vegetable),  pungent condiments, meat, fish, eggs, sweets, fried bread, curd, brinjal, carrots, black-gram, onions, garlic, lemon, masur, tea, coffee, betels, tobacco are Rajasic articles of food. </li>
                    <li>Rajasic food distracts the mind. It excites passion. Give up salt. It excites passion and emotion. Giving up of salt helps in the control of the palate and thereby the mind. The will power is also developed. Snake bite and scorpion sting will have no influence on a man who has given up salt. Onions and garlic are worse than meat. </li>

                    <li>Cannabis indica (ganja), bhang, opium, cocaine, charas, chandoo, all stale and putrid articles, are Tamasic. </li>
                    <li>The man whose taste is of a Tamasic nature will eat food in the afternoon that has been cooked on the previous day. He also likes that which is half-cooked or burnt to a cinder. </li>
                    <li>He and all the members of his family sit together and eat from the same dish or plate, food that has been mixed into a mess by his children. </li>
                    <li>The food eaten by Tamasic people is stale, dry, without juice, unripe or overcooked. They do not relish it, till it begins to rot and ferment. They take prohibited foods and drinks. They take liquors, fermented toddy, etc. They are horrible people with devilish tendencies. </li>
                    <li>Beef, wine, garlic, onions and tobacco are Tamasic foodstuffs. They fill the mind with anger, darkness and inertia. </li>
                    <li>The eating of meat and alcoholism are closely allied. The craving for liquor dies a natural death if meat is withdrawn from one’s diet. The question of birth-control becomes very difficult in the case of those who eat meat. To them mind control is next to impossible. Mark how the tiger, eating meat, and the cow or elephant, living on green grass, are poles apart! The one is wild and ferocious while the other is mild and peaceful. </li>
                    <li>The first and foremost step in the spiritual advancement of an aspirant is the giving up of meat. The Divine Light will not descend if the stomach is loaded with meat. Manu, Jesus, Buddha exhorted the people to refrain from using liquors, intoxicants and drugs as these are deleterious in their effects. No spiritual progress is possible without abandoning them. </li>
                    <li>Purity of food leads to purity of the mind. Sattwic food helps meditation. The discipline of food is very necessary for the successful practice of Yogic sadhana. If the palate is controlled, then all the other senses are also controlled. Boil half a litre of milk along with some boiled rice, ghee (clarified butter), and sugar. This is called Cheru. It is an excellent food for Yogis. This is for daytime. For the evening meal, half a litre of milk will do. </li>
                    <li>Milk is the best food for yogis but even a small quantity is harmful to some and may not agree with all constitutions. If one form of diet is not suitable, or if you feel constipated, change the diet and try some other Sattwic articles of food. This is common sense. </li>
                    <li>Milk should not be boiled too much. It should be removed from the fire as soon as the boiling point is reached. Too much boiling destroys the nutritive principles and vitamins and renders the milk quite useless. </li>

                    <li>One should, with concentrated attention, eat once in the morning and once in the evening, abstaining entirely from all food during the interval. One should never eat any food in which one may detect a hair. Nor should one eat at the Sraddha of an enemy. One should eat silently; one should never eat without covering one's person with an upper garment. One should never eat any food placing it on the bare ground. One should never eat except in a sitting posture. One should never eat while walking. One should never make any noise while eating. One who sits to one's meals after having washed one's feet, lives for a hundred years. One should first wash one's mouth thrice with water before any food.

                    <ul>
                    <li>Although meat is mandated in Ayurveda for debilitated patients, for warriors (Kshatriyas) and for those who overexert themselves, it is very heavy for digestion, putrefies faster than other foods and produces Ama (internal toxins) quickly. </li>
                    <li>Unless you exercise strenuously, regular meat eating will increase fat rather than flesh. It promotes speed rather than endurance, which is not good for Vata-affected individuals. Meat overheats the mind and warms the body, but even in cold climates, it should not be used to excess. Today's meat is also of poor quality, full of antibiotics and other drugs, taken from feedlot animals who never exercise so that all their Ama remains in their tissues. </li>
                    <li>Historically, the fear felt by the animal as it waits to be slaughtered and the hatred it feels for the human who slaughters it change the composition of its flesh and increase fear and anger in whoever eats it. The more the violence involved in the collection of our food, the greater the violence in our lives. Also, because digestive wastes are partly excreted in sweat, a meat-eater sits in his or her own odour daily, breathing in chemicals which promote fear and anger, and projecting this fear and anger out at others. </li>
                    <li>Food articles to which you should never become habituated because they are too heavy to be properly digested include yoghurt, pork, beef, mutton, dried meat, dried vegetables, molasses, and cheese, as well as any foods which are very cold, very hot, thoroughly tasteless, or too intense in taste. </li>
                    <li>Garlic and onions are both Rajasic and tamasic, and are forbidden to Yogis because they root the consciousness more firmly in the body. </li>

                    <p><ul>
                    <li>Do not eat when angry, depressed, bored, or otherwise emotionally unstable, or immediately after any physical exertion. </li>
                    <li>Bathe, or at least wash your hands, face and feet, before you begin to eat. </li>
                    <li>Sit while eating, in an isolated clean area. Face east if possible, the direction of the sun, the earth's source of heat and fire. Eat alone, or with people you know and trust. Ensure that all your sense organs are satisfied by providing your dining room with pleasant music, fresh flowers, and the like. </li>
                    <li>Avoid habitual use of restaurants. Most people who sell you food are more concerned with their own profits than with your digestion. Satiation is not determined by how much you eat. A small amount of food presented to you lovingly will satisfy your soul, whereas large heaps of food from a fast-food restaurant may temporarily fill your belly but will leave your mind and spirit unsatisfied. </li>
                    <li>Only someone who loves you should be permitted to cook for you. Cooks are often selected from the priestly class so that there is at least some chance that while cooking some spiritually uplifting vibrations may be transferred into the food. Women should not cook when they are menstruating because they are undergoing a cleansing process and should be relaxing instead. </li>
                    <li>It is best if your right nostril functions when you eat, since it increases your digestive fire. You can cause it to function by lying on your left side for a few minutes before the meal, by plugging your left nostril, by closing your left nostril with the middle finger of your right hand and breathing rhythmically through your right nostril for a few minutes, or by hooking your left arm over the back of a chair. </li>
                    <li>Once all is in readiness, pray. Give thanks to Nature for providing you with food, and thank whichever deity you worship for being alive to eat it. Approach each food item with reverence and love, even if you are served something which you dislike but must eat. Suppose your mother-in-law, whom you dislike, serves you rutabagas, which you hate. If wishing to maintain family peace and you eat the rutabagas under duress, those vegetables will carry your dislike and hatred deep into your system and disturb your balance. Consume your food, even if you dislike it, with respect for the sacrifice it is making for you, and it will carry the harmonizing power of your prayer inside you instead. </li>

                    <li>To the sacred fire, a cow, a crow, a dog, and another human being, who might be a child, a beggar, or anyone else outside one's own family? </li>
                    <li>This is a practical thanks to Nature, a feeding of some of her children in gratitude to her for providing you some of her other children as sacrifices for consumption. And, it is another way of controlling Ahamkara (egoism), an admission that the food is intended not for mere self-gratification but for the greater good of all beings. Feed anyone - a pet, a plant, a neighbour, a stranger- so you can experience a little of Nature's joy, the joy which a mother feels when she feeds her children and watches them grow and develop in consequence. </li>

                      <li>No television, radio, stereo or conversation should distract your attention. Observe silence while you eat; sit and chat afterwards. Chew each morsel slowly and attentively many times. When feasible, eat with your hands so that your skin can send temperature and texture cues to your brain. </li>
                      <li>Just as our bodies are made up of trillions of independent cells, we are all little cells in the universal organism. Like our cells, each of us humans has an individual existence but none of us is "free' enough to live independently of the whole. </li>
                      <li>In fact, everything which exists in the external universe has its counterpart in a living being's own personal internal universe. Every cosmic force is represented, in altered form. The flow of nutrients into the body and wastes out of the body cells also characterizes the continuous flow of nutrients and wastes into and out of plants, animals and humans. </li>
                      <li>There is therefore no inherent difference between, say, cooking your food in a pot on the stove and cooking your food in the pot of your stomach on the stove of your internal digestive "fire". Both use heat to prepare the food for easier assimilation. Flames are used on the external stove and acid and enzymes on the inside, but the principle of cooking is identical to both. </li>

                      <li>At the cellular level Vata moves nutrients into and wastes out of cells. Pitta digests nutrients to provide energy for cellular function. </li>
                      <li>The cell's structure is governed by Kapha. In the digestive tract Vata chews and swallows the food, Pitta digests it, Vata assimilates nutrients and expels wastes, and Kapha controls the secretions which lubricate and protect the digestive organs. </li>
                      <li>In the mind Vata retrieves previous data from memory for comparison with new data. Pitta processes the new data and draws conclusions, which Vata then stores as new memories. Kapha provides the stability needed for the mind to grasp a single thought at a time. </li>
                      <li>These three are forces, not substances. Kapha is not mucus; it is the force which when projected into the body causes mucus to arise. Pitta is not bile; it is the force which causes bile to be produced. Vata is not gas, but increased Vata causes increased gas. Vatta, Pitta and Kapha are called Doshas because the word Doshas means "things which can go out of whack." When Vata, Pitta and Kapha are out of balance with one another the system is bound to lose its own balance. </li>
                      <li>Vata, Pitta and Kapha are all essential to life, but can cause great harm if they are allowed to fall out of harmony with one another. This two-faced personality exists because they are Doshas, things which are often in error. This is not really their fault, because they have such difficult jobs to do. Kapha must overcome the mutual indifference of Water and Earth and make them work together. Pitta must conquer the natural animosity which Water and Fire feel for one another. Vata is forced to use the inert Space to try to control the capricious Air. It is in fact surprising that they function as well as they do. </li>
                      <li>Because they are so reactive the body cannot afford to store them within itself for long, any more than a nuclear power plant can afford to store radioactive wastes. They are therefore eliminated from the body regularly in the course of performing their functions. The force of Kapha is continually expelled from the body via mucus, Pitta is regularly expelled through acid and bile, and Vata is eliminated both as gas and as muscular or nervous energy. </li>

                    <h2>The Six Tastes.</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                          How much of each Dosha your body produces depends primarily on which Tastes you consume. The tastes influence the balance of the Doshas in the body. Like the Doshas they are derived from the Five Great Elements. They have profound effect on all parts of the organism and not merely the tongue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                 <ul> 
                    <li><b>Sweet.</b> Composed mainly of Earth and Water. Sweet increases Kapha, decreases Pitta and Vata, and is cooling, heavy and unctuous. It nourishes and exhilarates the body and mind, and relieves hunger and thirst. It increases all tissues. Sweet produces satisfaction or satiation. Overindulgence in Sweet Taste leads to its negative aspects, complacency and greed. Intense complacent effect increases the naturally inert, complacent Kapha, cools the anger of Pitta and comforts the fear of Vata.</li>
                    <li><b>Sour.</b> Composed mainly of Earth and Fire. Sour increases Kapha and Pitta, decreases Vata, and is heating, heavy, and unctuous. Sour refreshes the being, encourage elimination of wastes, lessens spasms and tremors, and improves appetite and digestion. Produces the searching outside oneself for things to possess. Sour causes evaluation of a thing in order to determine its desirability which selectively enhances certain appetites. Overindulgence in evaluation leads to envy and jealousy, which may manifest as deprecation of the thing desired, as in the "sour grapes" syndrome. Envious effect increases Kapha if envy of another's success incites you to obtain further success for yourself. Otherwise Pitta will increase as jealousy mutates into anger over the raw deal you feel you are getting from life.  Envy does help reduce Vata, by focusing and heating up your consciousness.</li>
                    <li><b>Salty.</b> Composed mainly of Water and Fire. Salty increases Kapha and Pitta, decreases Vata, and is heavy, heating and unctuous. Salty eliminates wastes and cleanses the body , and increases the digestive capacity and appetite. It softens and loosens the tissues. Salty Taste increases zest for life, which enhances all appetites. Overindulgence in zest leads to hedonism, the craving for indulgence in all sensory pleasures physically available to the body.</li>
                    <li><b>Pungent.</b> Composed mainly of Fire and Air. pungent (which is hot and spicy like chilli peppers) increases Pitta and Vata, decreases Kapha, and is heating, light and dry. Pungent flushes all types of secretion from the body, and reduces all Kapha-like tissues such as semen, milk and fat. It improves the appetite. Pungent Taste is productive of extroversion, the tendency to excitement and stimulation, and particularly the craving for intensity. Overexcitement and over-stimulation leads to irritability, impatience and anger (pungent language or a sharp retort). Pungent Taste increases Pitta by actively increasing the flow of hormones and digestive juices, making it easier both to digest and to manifest anger. It relieves Kapha by decreasing self-satisfaction, and temporarily relieves Vata by permitting expression of bottled-up resentment. In the long run, however, Pungent increases Vata by exhausting the organs and glands, which, "dries you out", limiting your ability to project aggression or unhappiness outwards.
                    <li><b>Bitter.</b> Composed mainly of Air and Space. Bitter increases Vata, decreases Pitta and Kapha, and is cooling, light and dry. Bitter purifies and dries all secretions, is anti-aphrodisiac, and tones the organism by returning all Tastes to normal balance. It increases appetite, and controls skin diseases and fevers.Bitter Taste produces dissatisfaction , which produces a desire to change. When you have to swallow a "bitter pill"' its bitterness dispels your self-delusion and forces you to face reality. Too much disappointment leads to frustration, which confirms your system in bitterness. Grief is also bitter.Bitter is best of all Six Tastes. As Dr. Vasant Lad says, "Bitter is better."  in small amounts Bitter helps balance all other tastes in the body. Just as mild dissatisfaction with yourself or your situation impels you to change, Bitter dilates channels which are too constricted, thus reducing Kapha and its complacency , and constricts those which are overdilated, thus reducing Pitta and its anger. Overuse of Bitter increases Vata as dissatisfaction and continuous change induces insecurity and fear.</li>
                    <li><b>Astringent.</b> Composed mainly of Air and Earth. Astringent (which makes your mouth pucker) increases Vata, decreases Pitta and Kapha, and is cooling, light and dry. Astringent heals, purifies and constricts all parts of the body. It reduces all secretions, and is anti-aphrodisiac. Astringent Taste produces introversion, the tendency away from excitement and stimulation. Excessive introversion leads to insecurity, anxiety and fear. Astringency causes contraction, which makes you "shrivel like a prune." and clamps the "cold, bony hand of fear" around your throat. Astringent taste constricts, drawing one away from the self-satisfaction of Kapha, and the self-aggrandisement of Pitta. Its constriction increases fear of insufficient sensory "nutrition" and leads to increased Vata.</li>
                    </ul></p>
                      <p>
                      All these tastes are essential for proper functioning of the organism, and reach us primarily through our food.

                      <li>Your personal constitution, which is your individual metabolic makeup, helps determine how much effect specific tastes and emotions have on you. This is why everyone who eats the same food does not necessarily suffer from exactly the same mental and physical effects from it. When all the members of a family enjoy a meal together, each individual's tastes and emotions will be affected according to his or her own individual taste and emotional balance. </li>
                      <li>Your inborn metabolic pattern is called "Prakrti", which also means Nature, She who is the first creation. [See page "Maya"].</li>
                      <li>Your constitution is that set of metabolic tendencies which determine how your body and mind will instinctively react when they are confronted by a stimulus. </li>
                      <li>Knowing your constitution allows you to know your body and mind better. You learn why there is no need to feel guilty for your dietary preferences, or for your mental traits like anger or fear. Once you understand that these traits are determined by your constitution, lifestyle changes can help your organism minimize their influence. </li>

                    <p><ul>
                    <li>Your personal constitution was determined by the state of the bodies of your mother and father at the time of your conception. That certain sperm which could best endure the conditions prevalent in those two bodies won the race to reach the ovum, and its genes mingled with the genes in the ovum to form the new child. </li>
                    <li>Your constitution is influenced by your parent's genetics, by your mother's diet and habits during her pregnancy, and by any abnormal events at the time of your birth. Once you’re personal constitution and its accompanying tendencies have been set they cannot be permanently altered. Like your genes, you have your constitution for the rest of your life, like it or not. </li>
                    <li>You can, however, learn to adjust for your constitution so that you are less affected by its distortions. You can learn how to prevent health imbalances and how to best treat them when they arise. You can know the prognosis of any disease you might contract, and you can determine which rejuvenation program will be best for you. </li>
                    <li>Through study and use of Ayurvedic principles you can also understand why your spouse, children, relatives, friends, neighbors and co-workers do the things they do, and determine how best to interact with them for maximum inter-personal harmony. You can plan meals for your family according to what is best for each of their prakrtis. </li>
                    <li>Because every individual is composed of a body, a mind and a spirit, the ancient Rishis who developed the science of Life organized their wisdom into three bodies of knowledge: </li>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Ayurveda, which deals mainly with the physical body; </li>
                    <li>Yoga, which deals mainly with the spirit; </li>
                    <li>Tantra, which is mainly concerned with the mind. </li>
                    </ol></p>
                    <p>
                    <li>The philosophy of all three is identical; their manifestations differ because of their differing emphasis. </li>
                    <li>Ayurveda is mostly concerned with the physical basis of life, concentrating on its harmony to induce harmony of mind and spirit. </li>
                    <li>Yoga controls body and mind to enable them to harmonies with spirit, and tantra seeks to use the mind to balance the demands of body and spirit. </li>
                    <li>Ayurveda was designed by the Rishis especially for those individuals who want to enjoy the world healthily. Its daily and seasonal routines, dietary guidance, therapeutics and doctrines of antidotes for the side-effects of addictions can keep you hale, hearty and having a high time well into your senescence if you can restrict yourself sufficiently to follow these precepts strictly. You must consciously choose how much you wish to indulge, which determines how healthy you will be. </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p>
                    <h2>Obesity-Losing weight.</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p><ul>
                      <li>If you are overweight and suffer from all or most of the following symptoms, you urgently need to reduce your poundage (under professional competent guidance): </li>
                      </p>
                      <p><ol>
                      <li>Pendulous belly, breasts and buttocks; </li>

                      <li>Profuse perspiration even when it is not hot; </li>
                      <li>Excess thirst, especially at night; </li>
                      <li>Intense food craving; </li>
                      <li>Prolonged but unsatisfying sleep; </li>
                      <li>Unpleasant body odour; </li>

                      <li>Generalized body ache; </li>
                      <li>Loss of sexual appetite; </li>
                      <li>Lack of zeal or enthusiasm for living. </li>
                      </ol></p>
                      <p>
                      <li>If you do not suffer from most of these symptoms you should not attempt severe dieting. You cannot be in any hurry if you want to make your weight loss permanent. Your body needs time to readjust itself and lower its fat setpoint, and until that setpoint drops your weight will not. </li>
                      <li>All foods, which increase Kapha, tend to increase weight. Likewise, all foods, which control Kapha, discourage weight gain. You should especially avoid the following foods: </li>
                      <li>Beef and pork; butter, cheese, ice-cream, sour cream, wheat and wheat products; white sugar and all products containing white sugar; alcoholic beverages; fried foods of any sort; junk foods and fast foods; all excessively sour or salty foods like pickles. </li>
                      <li>Merely going on an anti-Kapha diet when you want to lose weight may be entirely inappropriate if you are a Vata person who needs Kapha promoting foods to maintain balance. It would be best for you to stabilise your diet first after removing all the objectionable foods above. Unless your Doshas are balanced your Dhatus including Fat will never become healthy. </li>
                      <li>Permanent weight loss occurs only when the body's fat setpoint is lowered. The amphetamines in prescription diet pills and the nicotine in tobacco can temporarily lower the fat setpoint, but these effects last only as long as you use the drug. You are bound to gain weight as soon as you stop smoking or quit swallowing the pills. Besides, both amphetamines and nicotine are addictive drugs; nicotine is even more addictive than heroine. These two drugs lower the body's fat setpoint by speeding up the organism, making both body and brain work faster. </li>
                      <li>Ayurveda believes in speeding up the organism in healthy, natural ways, such as exercise, certain supplements, and the use of light, non-Kapha producing foods, which control Vata while relieving the system of excess Kapha. It is a slower process, but in weight loss, as in all other aspects of medicine, haste makes waste. </li>
                      </ul></p>
                      <p>
                      <h2>Change your diet gradually.</h2>
                      </p>
                      <p><ul> 
                      <li>Do not salt your food at all. If you want the salty taste, use "light" salt, kelp powder, or liquid amino-acid mixtures. Limit your use of sweeteners, but allow yourself regular use of honey, except in cooking. Honey has a mild fat reducing effect. Take bran or psyllium seed husk whenever you eat a lot of sweet. Fibre helps the body balance its response to Sweet. Even though fruits are sweet, their fibre usually does not permit their sugars to be absorbed too quickly. The fibre in whole grains also protects against exaggerated blood sugar levels. </li>
                      <li>Carbohydrates like grains also increase brain serotonin, a chemical which makes you feel relaxed and "mellow". So, even though a high protein diet may make you lose weight faster, you will lose it more enjoyably and in a more relaxed fashion if you eat a reasonable amount of carbohydrate. Also, fat requires carbohydrate to burn, so trying to deny yourself all carbohydrate while you live on protein and vegetables makes the weight loss more difficult and less certain. </li>
                      <li>As you feel it is safe and sensible to do so, reduce the quantity of food you eat at each meal. As you reduce your food quantity your stomach will shrink little by little and you will find your capacity for food reduced. Excessive eating is often more a problem with overweight Vata and Pitta types than it is with overweight Kapha types whose bodies tend to hang on to excess pounds even if they do not overeat. </li>
                      <li>Eliminate all cold food and drink. You should eat nothing that is refrigerator cold. Fat is the body’s insulation and increases naturally in colder climates. Continuous exposure to cold food and drink, and even to air conditioning, convinces the body that it should add extra insulation, so up goes the fat setpoint. Exercise, which helps heat the body, reduces its need for insulation. </li>
                      <li>Reduce your overall water intake as you reduce the salt in your diet. You should drink when you are thirsty, but you do not necessarily need the 6 to 8 glasses of water daily, which some "authorities" advocate. Warm water or hot herbal teas help melt fat away. Even better is honey and lemon in warm water, with a pinch of black pepper powder. </li>
                      <li>When you are fed up with all these restrictions, go out and binge without guilt, preferably on healthful foods, and then forget about it. Cravings for your old food friends are only panic reactions of your body or mind. If you reassure yourself with familiar food that you are not trying to starve to death, the craving to binge will become less and less frequent. </li>
                      <li>It is wise to take vitamin and mineral supplements during this period of transition to ensure that your body does not lack any nutrients. These supplements cannot reduce your fat setpoint, although Ayurvedic herbal preparations can. These preparations mobilise fat from deposits and eliminate it. These are not appetite suppressants. They are substances which encourage permanent metabolic change so that dietary control and exercise can make the excess fat swiftly disappear and stay away once it is gone. </li>
                      <li>Any bitter, pungent or astringent food, herb or mineral will exert some weight reducing effect, though some are more active than others are. A few active herbs are barberry, black pepper, gentian, golden seal, gotukola, red raspberry leaves, saffron, and tumeric. Some Ayurvedic compounds, which are prescribed in India for weight reduction, include: </li>
                      <li>The powder called Triphala, a mixture of three fruits, especially when mixed with Trikatu, a mixture of equal parts of powdered ginger, black pepper, and pippali or long pepper. </li>
                      <li>Fat is essential Dhatu and is good for you, in the proper amount. </li>
                    </ul></p>

                    <p><ul>
                    <li>A people need to concentrate on Bitter, Pungent and Astringent foods, which invigorate their bodies and minds, and should avoid sweet, sour and salty substances, which help them remain, set in their ways. You should never eat fried or otherwise greasy food, and should shun dairy products. Fat is the worst possible food for You. Vegetables are best for you, who should limit the total amount of food they eat.</li>
                    </p>
                    <p><ol>
                    <li> <b>Grains.</b>People need grain.The hot, drying grains buckwheat and millet are best for you, followed by barley, rice and corn. People do best with roasted or otherwise dry-cooked grains. All breads should be toasted, or better yet avoided. Wheat is too heavy, cold and oily. </li>
                    <li><b>Vegetables.</b>All vegetables are good for you except potatoes, tomatoes, and water chestnuts. Cucumbers, though sweet, are also bitter and astringent and therefore do not aggravate Kapha. People should avoid very sweet, very sour and very juicy vegetables. Otherwise they can eat as many vegetables as they like as often as they like. Leafy greens and vegetables which contain seeds (like squashes) should get preference over root vegetables, which are naturally more earthy. Raw vegetables are good; steamed or stir-fried vegetables are easier to digest. Peppers are good for you. People who overdose on chilies, cayenne, or other hot pungent spices may use ghee to antidote any resulting Pitta aggravation. </li>
                    <li><b>Fruits.</b>People should avoid both very sweet and very sour fruits, and any fruits which are very juicy. Dried fruits like prunes are good. The best fruits for you are apples, apricots, cranberries, mangoes, peaches, pears, and pomegranates. </li>
                    <li><b>Flesh Foods.</b>People rarely need any flesh foods because their flesh is adequately nourished by other foods. When they do eat flesh it should be roasted, broiled, baked, or otherwise cooked dry, but never fried. They may eat chicken, eggs, rabbit, seafood, and venison. </li>
                    <li><b>Legumes.</b>People should not overeat legumes any more than they should overeat meat, because their bodies do not require large quantities of protein. Legumes are much better for you than meat because of the lack of animal fat in legumes.People should however avoid the heaviest of the legumes, such as black lentils, kidney beans, and soybeans. Well-cooked tofu is permissible for you in small quantities. Larger quantities are likely to increase Kapha. The best legumes for people are black beans, mung beans, pinto beans, and red lentils. </li>
                    <li><b>Nuts and seeds.</b>People do not need the heavy, oily energy of nuts and seeds and should avoid them. They may eat sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds on occasion. </li>
                    <li><b>Oils.</b>People should avoid the use of oils. They may use almond, corn, safflower, or sunflower oils when necessary. </li>
                    <li><b>Dairy.</b>People do not need the heavy, oily, sticky, cooling qualities of dairy products, which are very like Kapha’s own qualities. Small amounts of ghee are good, and goat’s milk is better than cow’s milk because it is "Hotter". Goat’s milk is good for respiratory diseases in any constitution. Yogurt increases Kapha because its qualities are almost exactly the same as those of Kapha. Honey reduces yogurt’s Kapha forming qualities, and spices antidote it even further. The addition of water to this spiced yogurt dilutes it, and churning breaks up its gel structure to make it less slimy and viscid. The resultant mixture aggravates Kapha very little and promotes digestion greatly. </li>
                    <li><b>Sweeteners.</b>Kapha is increased by sweets, and should not use any sweeteners except raw honey, which helps reduce Kapha. </li>
                    <li><b>Spices.</b>People find spices useful to awaken their organisms; they can use all spices except salt, which increases Kapha directly. As for Vata people, ginger and garlic are best for you. </li>

                    <p>
                    <b>FEAR</b> often kills outright. No greater annihilator is known than fear. Fear is upon all, especially is this true in distressing times of financial and economic depression , wars and rumors of wars, political uncertainties etc. Fear of war, fear of death, fear of losing one's position, fear of poverty- fear is upon all. No one escapes. </p>
                    <p><ul>
                    <li>Fear that does not find normal muscular expression is the most destructive of all emotions. It benumbs and paralyses the body and wastes nerve energy as few other things do. There is a striking similarity between great fear and freezing. In both cases the face is blanched, the teeth chatter, the body trembles (shivers) becomes cramped and bent, the chest is contracted, and breathing is slow and comes in short gasps.

                    <p><b>Violent fits of passion</b> will often arrest, alter or derange the functions of the body as quickly as an electric shock. Digestion may be wholly suspended by a profound state of fear, worry, anxiety or suspense. Fright, anxiety or even sudden joy is often immediately followed by diarrhea (running stomach). Many students who have been exceedingly anxious about their examinations have experienced a diarrhea as a result. These same influences have all been observed to cause the appearance of sugar in the urine.</p>

It is known that such emotions as fear, worry, jealousy, anger etc., will reduce the secretion of milk and impair its food value to such an extent that the infant does not thrive on it. </li>
                    <li>As another example of the effects of fear upon secretion, there is the well known graying of the hair in those who have been profoundly shocked through fear or by some great horror. Men sentenced to death often become grey haired in a few days. This loss of color by the hair is due to the suspension of the secretion of minute glands at the roots of the hair caused by fear. </li>

                    <b>WORRY</b> is a baby fear. It impairs secretion and excretion and depresses all the functions of the body. The secretions are altered and nutrition is impaired. Poisons accumulate in the body. The victim gradually wastes away. None of the functions of the body are carried on properly under such a state of mind. The appetite is impaired and digestion is weakened. Every time there is a panic in the stock market the stock brokers rush to their physicians to be cured of constipation or of a functional glycosuria (sugar in the urine).

                    <b>GRIEF</b> is among the mental states that exert the most profound, far-reaching and powerful effects upon the body. As in fear, in grief also, the hair has been changed from black to grey in a few days. The secretion of the mother's milk is checked and altered as surely and as quickly by grief as by lack of or by change of food. One of the most immediate effects of grief is to reduce and impair secretion and function. Intense grief often kills outright. Sorrow, as in disappointed love often produces a wasted, weakened state of the body resembling consumption. Blighted love constitutes one of the most fruitful sources of indisposition. Grief takes away appetite instantly. It will be a punishment to eat under such circumstances. Food consumed under such conditions would have fermented and putrefied and poisoned the body.</p>

It may cause collapse and death. Secretion and excretion are impaired, elimination is checked, digestion is deranged, nutrition perverted, profound enervation is produced and toxemia grows daily. Weight is lost. Appetite is lacking. Disease and death may easily result.</li>

Lying, stealing, cheating, gambling and all forms of dishonesty, produce enervation and hardening of the arteries. In all of these there is the fear of being found out. In gambling, there is tension and the fear of losing. Before conscience becomes hardened there is the stinging lash of remorse and loss of self respect. These things create a mental state that expends nerve energy.</li>

<ul>
<li>It does one little good to eat a perfect diet, if his mental state is such as to impair and prevent digestion. Gloominess and grouchiness lead to an early grave. </li>
<li>Happiness, contentment and cheer should be cultivated with as much care and persistency as the gardener exercises in the cultivation of his plants. </li>
<li>One who thinks hate, vengeance, spite all the time will quickly arouse corresponding emotions. He who thinks love, peace, goodwill, will be slow to anger. If man keeps his thoughts on things true, honorable, just, pure, love, courage, beauty, harmony, lovely, of good rapport and worthy of praise, there will be no room in his mind for things unchaste, dishonorable, unjust, untrue, of evil rapport and unworthy of praise. </li>
<li>Our thinking largely determines us. As the mental state determines the physical state; so the mind makes its body. He who cultivates a philosophical view of life and strives after emotional poise may have it. It is as easy to cultivate cheer, courage and contentment as it is to cultivate cabbage. </li>
<li><b>Dr.Paul Carton wrote:</b>" People spiteful and vindictive towards other men, brutal and cruel to animals, destroying without reason inanimate things, live in a venomous and cataclysmic atmosphere. They doom themselves to unhappiness and sickness. Only those that are kindly and altruistic, that love not only their parents, their children, their friends, but are neither mean nor vindictive to their enemies, may enjoy complete physical peace and moral harmony." </li>
<li>In our emotional life there exists a perennial need of a steadying and directive principle, such as religion and ethics can supply. The individual who can bury himself in some worthy cause, some cause that is bigger than he is, and devote his energies and efforts to this cause is doubly safeguarded against emotional over-irritation. The over-selfish person who works for nothing save himself is doomed to emotional destruction. </li>
<li>Happiness is man's normal state, but excessive joy and happiness produce a weakening of the system. Joy and happiness are essential to health. </li>
<li>There are few hygienic influences that are equally as conducive to health and long life as a cheerful, equitable state of mind. Cheer is to the body what sunshine and dew are to the grasses and flowers. It promotes digestion, paints the cheeks, puts a bright sparkle into the eyes and lends a buoyancy and elasticity to one's tread. Any mental state that does not promote cheer, that puts a harshness into ones words and expressions that blanches one's cheeks and dulls the natural sparkle of the eyes, exerts a depressing effect upon every function of the body and plays havoc with all the forces of life. </li>

<p>"When our activities are set toward a precise end, our mental and organic functions become completely harmonious.... In order to keep his mental and organic balance, man must impose upon himself an inner rule. The mind is hidden within the living matter.... completely neglected by physiologists and economists, almost unnoticed by physicians. Yet it is the most colossal power of this world."</p>

<p>
<h2>Nutrition and physical degeneration.</h2>
</p>
<p>"The differences between the modern civilizations and many of the primitive groups are interesting. Criminal tendencies in isolated primitives are so slight that no prisons are required." "Among primitive races living in a primitive state childbirth was very simple and rapid process, accompanied by little fear or apprehension ; whereas, in the modernized descendants, even in the first and second generations of those individuals born to parents after they had adopted the foods of modern civilizations, serious trouble was often experienced."<br> <b> (Weston A. Price D.D.S.) </b></p>

<p><ul>
<li>It has long been known that primitive people, prior to their contacts with civilization, had excellent teeth. It also has been established that teeth are a valuable indicator of general physical condition: excellent teeth and excellent general physique go hand in hand. Unfortunately, the converse of this is also true. </li>
<li>The curse of civilization - modern food refinement - is the chief offender. In addition any deviation in living or eating pattern interfering with a harmonious degree of body metabolism contributes to the decay found in our buccal cavities. </li>
<li>The great American scientist, Dr.Weston A. Price, had an extensive dental practice in Cleveland, Ohio, (USA). He became tired of trying to remove a symptom by treating sick teeth from the outside. While his colleagues were experimenting with new methods for controlling dental caries, Dr.Price was conducting research to learn why the primitive had such good teeth, and how this knowledge could benefit his civilized brother. </li>
<li>At the age of sixty, with great enthusiasm, the dentist explorer went around the world. By planes, ships, and by car, on horse back and on foot, the untiring gatherer of facts amassed a tremendous volume of evidence to demonstrate what happens when primitive people adopt the white man's diet. The evidence was shocking but irrefutable. </li>
<li>He investigated groups all over the world; in the Swiss Alps, New Hebrides, Australia, Alaska, South America, Africa, among others. The climates, people and even the diets varied, but all shared one thing - excellent nutrition. These people, drawing from the sources nature provided, instinctively supplied all their body needs-just as did the Hunzas. </li>
<li>Through laboratory analysis, Dr. Price discovered that although the foods varied according to the area, the total intake of vitamins and minerals was nearly identical. </li>
<li>These admirable physical specimens possessed unbelievable endurance, and cheerful, even dispositions; their jaws were wide and well developed, and their teeth stayed free from tooth Decay, just as their bodies remained free of disease; cancer, tuberculosis, high blood pressure, kidney and heart diseases, polio, cerebral palsy and other degenerative diseases were non-existent. Every mother nursed her baby; a non-functional breast was unheard of. Mental health was as high as physical health. </li>
<li>Isolated tribes were visited where all members had perfectly sound mouth structures. As long as the tribe would continue their established eating and living pattern, there would be no tooth problem- with even the oldest members having full sets of teeth with barely a single cavity. </li>
<li>In every instance, Dr. Price was able to compare his people with people living nearby of the same racial stock; sometimes the healthy specimens could be compared to their offspring who had been exposed to the city. </li>
<li>Man's diet of white flour, refined sugar, polished rice and caned foods. The deteriorating that had resulted was pitiful and obvious: faulty bone structure, crooked teeth, extreme tooth decay, and high incidence of disease. Cancer was rampant among the very tribes that had stayed cancer-free on their native diets. </li>
<li>In both his observations on these people, and through animal experiments, Dr.Price was able to demonstrate the devastating effects of bad nutrition, not only of the present generation but also - far worse - on their offspring. His book - Nutrition and Physical Degeneration- has scores of pictures testifying to the destructive results from the white man's processed foods. </li>
<li>There was not a single toothbrush found by Dr.Price, whenever he found the enviable sets of glistening white and pearly teeth of primitives. </li>
<li>Dr.Price urged a return to harmony with nature by choosing foods in their natural state: all intemperate with by man. Dr.Price gives this warning: "...we cannot distort and rob ... foods without serious injury. </li>
<li>Nature has put these foods up in packages containing the combinations of minerals and other factors that are essential for nourishing the various organs.... our modern process of robbing the natural foods for convenience or gain completely thwarts nature's inviolable programmed... the robbing of the wheat in the making of white flour reduced the minerals and other chemicals in the grains, so as to make them sources of energy without normal body-building and repairing qualities. Our appetites have been distorted so that hunger applies only for energy with no conscious need for body-building and repairing chemicals." </li>

<h2>The Hunza health secrets</h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>How the body is affected by the quality of food ingested the most amazing and remarkable health and vitality of the Himalayan people of Hunza</li>
<li>For centuries rumors of an earthly paradise hidden in an almost inaccessible valley in the high Himalayas intrigued the outside world with stories of a 'Lost race' that had learned to stop the ageing process. </li>
<li>Occasional travelers returned with incredible stories of a nation where people stayed youthfully active for as long as they lived and where "young" oldsters of a hundred years or more were the rule instead of the exception. </li>
<li>After two thousand years of almost complete isolation, the people of Hunza have made the secrets of their remarkable way of long and healthy life available to the rest of the world. </li>
<li>They have evolved a way of living, eating and thinking that has substantially lengthened their lifespan and dramatically reduced susceptibility to most of the illnesses to which "civilized" people are prone. </li>
<li>In Hunza, people manage to live to over one hundred years of age in perfect mental and physical health; and men father children at ninety. Cancer, heart disease, heart attacks, high and low blood pressure and childhood diseases are virtually unknown. In fact, sickness is extremely rare. There is no juvenile delinquency in Hunza, and divorce is a rarity. There are no jails, no police, and no army. There is no need for them, as there has not been a crime reported for the last one hundred and fifty years. </li>
<li>Dr.Robert McCarrison, the brilliant English surgeon, took up the study of certain diseases common to the people of Asia. He was interested in finding out to what degree diseases in Indian peoples were caused by faulty food. </li>
<li>He was amazed by the remarkable health and vitality of these people. He wrote in his classic book 'Studies in deficiency diseases': </li>
<li>My own experience provides an example of a race unsurpassed in perfection of physique and in freedom from disease in general. I refer to the people of the State of Hunza, situated in the extreme northernmost point of India (now part of Pakistan). Amongst these people the span of life is extraordinarily long. </li>
<li>During the period of my association with these people, I never saw a case of asthenic dyspepsia, of gastric or duodenal ulcer, or appendicitis, or mucous colitis, or cancer. </li>
<li>Dr.McCarrison puzzled over why the Hunzas should have enjoyed health so superior to that of their dyspeptic neighbours. He found that the Pathans, who live in the region of the Khyber Pass, were great hillsmen and adept at primitive agriculture. They are comparatively well and were by no means a lazy people.The Sikhs also fit into this category. In an article written by him in 1925, Dr.McCarrison wrote that the Sikhs, the Pathans and other Himalayan tribes "are of fine physical development and power of endurance, but by no means even compare with the Hunzakuts." </li>
<li>The question that now absorbed his mind was: "How is it that man can be such a magnificent creature as the Hunzakut? And he proceeded to view the ills of both civilised and primitive man. </li>
<li>The only difference he could find was in their diet. The Hunzas practised a Spartan form of agriculture, returning all organic matter to the soil. Their food consisted chiefly of raw fruits and vegetables, sprouted pulses, whole grains, nuts milk products from goats, and occasionally a small portion of meat, usually during holidays and weddings. Since chickens have a natural urge to peck at seeds, and since seeds are more valuable than money in Hunza, until recently no chickens were allowed in the state. </li>
<li>The Hunzas grow apples, pears, peaches, apricots, black and red cherries, mulberries; and the stones of the fresh apricot are cracked open and kernels also eaten. They eat their vegetables mostly raw. They grow spinach lettuce; carrots, peas, turnips, squash, young leaves and various herbs, and they sprout pluses and eat them. </li>
<li>Whole grains: wheat, barley, buckwheat, and small grains. Of cereal foods they eat wheat and a great deal of millet. By stone grinding the whole grain remains in the flour and as a result is very nourishing. </li>
<li>Nuts: the Persian Walnut, almonds, pecans, hazelnut, apricot kernel. These are an excellent source of high grade proteins and fats. 
<li>Very little fat of any kind is consumed by the people through ghee, butter apricot oil and negligible quantities of animal fats. Apricot kernel oil is the most important source of fat. </li>
<li>Milk products: fresh milk, unboiled, unpasteurised and buttermilk, clarified butter(ghee) cottage cheese, yoghurt and sour milk. </li>
<li>Meat does not form an important part of the Hunzan way of life. </li>
<li>Most foods are consumed raw. Complete absence of foreign additives. Nothing whatsoever is added to either the soil or the food of the people or the animals. </li> 
<li>No sprays or spray materials of any kind are used on their crops, and no unnatural chemical fertilizers are used on their lands. All fruits and vegetables that are dried for storing have been exposed to the sun and air. No foreign substances are added or treatments used. </li>
<li>All children in Hunza are breast fed. A boy child is breast fed for three years and girl child for two years. There is no specific prenatal care, and the good health of the mother is passed on to the infant...and the breast feeding gets the child off to an extremely good start. </li>
<li>It is interesting to note that in Hunza no one eats before going to bed at night. None of the people, including children, eat between meals. There are practically no cases of overweight among the people of Hunza. </li>
<li>Hunzans are light eaters. Their diet is comparatively meagre. They use less fat of any kind than most people found throughout the world. They have very little animal fat and no fish. And yet there are no more energetic people found in the world and they are continually active. </li>
<li>We are taught that the diet should consist of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, water and oxygen. However, it is doubtful that the Hunzakuts are aware of these facts. </li>
<li>The scriptures say "Disease never comes without a cause. The way is prepared, and disease invited, by disregard of the laws of health and of nature. </li>
<li>A large part of our nutritional problems grow out of our refusal to eat natural foods. Our preference for the manufactured articles-those that have been </li>dematerialized, devitaminised, denatured, standardized, pasteurized, homogenized, cooked, canned, frozen, and in other ways rendered less valuable as foods-creates dietary problems that are not adequately solved by the present reliance upon supplements and substitutes. </li>
<li>We go to great lengths to spoil our foods and then complain about the climate. We live on a diet of white flour products, degerminated and demineralised corn meal, denatured cereal, white sugar, pasteurized milk, embalmed flesh foods, canned fruits and vegetables, candies, cakes, pies etc., and expect to render such diets adequate by” supplementing" them with fish oils, brewer's yeast, wheat germ, black strap molasses, honey, yoghurt, powdered skimmed milk, cider vinegar, etc. </li>
<li>"The strange absence of principle which characterizes this generation, and which is shown in their disregard of the laws of life and health, is astonishing. Ignorance prevails upon this subject, while light is shining all around them."-Counsels on diet and foods. </li>
<li>Dr.McCarrison noted that the neighbouring villages to the State of Hunza were addicted to white man's foods. To test his theory that foods made the difference, Dr.McCarrison began his historic feeding experiments in1927. </li>
<li>For the first phase of his experiments, Dr.McCarrison chose healthy albino rats, and then placed them in good conditions with fresh air, sunlight, comfort and cleanliness. He chose their diet from foods eaten regularly by the Hunzakuts: chapattis made of whole meal flour, lightly smeared with fresh butter; sprouted pulse; fresh raw carrots; raw cabbage; unboiled milk; a small ration of meat with bones once a week, and an abundance of water. </li>
<li>In this experiment almost 1200 rats were watched from birth to the twenty-seventh month, an age in the rat which corresponds to that of about fifty years in a man. At this stage some of the the Hunza-diet-fed rats were killed and carefully examined. Dr.McCarrison's report was remarkable: </li>
<li>"During the past two and a quarter years there has been no case of illness in this "universe" of albino rats, no death from natural causes in the adult stock, and, but for a few accidental deaths, no infantile mortality. Both clinically and at post-mortem, examination of this stock has been shown to be remarkably free from disease. I have failed to find either clinical or microscopical evidence of any hidden disease. </li>
<li>His experiments did not, however, stop here. Next he took diseased rats and placed them too, on the Hunzakut diet. They all became well. The results startled even Dr.McCarrison. Then he took batches of rats and placed them in clean, comfortable surroundings and fed them the food of the people of India. The rats living on the various Indian diets, which consisted of rice, pulses, cooked vegetables and condiments, were soon plagued with diseases and miseries of many kinds. </li>
<li>In every case the average health standard of the people whose diet was fed to the rats was mirrored in the health of the animals, including the percentage of specific diseases, and even mental condition and temper. The rats that ate the diet of the Hunzas had the same astonishing health, vitality and gentle tempers; the animals grew rapidly, were never ill, had healthy offspring, and autopsy revealed virtually nothing wrong with their organs. </li>
<li>During the course of his experiments on some 2243 rats fed on faulty Indian diets, he found and listed diseases of every organ of the body. </li>
<li>Among the ailments they suffered were diseases of the respiratory system, adenoids, pneumonia, bronchitis, pleurisy, pyothorax and infections of the nose; infections of the ear; infections of the eye; dilated stomach, growths, ulcer and cancer of the stomach, inflammation of the small and large gut; constipation and diarrhea; diseases of the urinary passage, such as Bright's disease, stones, abscesses, inflammation of the bladder; inflammation of the womb and ovaries, death of the fetus, premature birth, hemorrhage; diseases of the testicles; inflammation of the skin, loss of hair, ulcers, abscesses, gangrene of the feet; anemia of the blood; enlarged lymphatic glands, cystic and suppurating glands; goiter and diseases of the special glands; wasting, enlargement of, and inflammation of the muscle, and inflammation of the outer lining of the heart; inflammation and degeneration of the nervous tissues, diseased teeth and bones; dropsy; scurvy; feeble growth, feeble appetite, weakness, lassitude, and ill temper. </li>
<li>Dr.McCarrison wrote, "All these conditions, these conditions of ill health had a common causation: faulty nutrition with or without infection. I found that when, growing rats of healthy stock were fed on diets similar to those of people whose physique was good, the physique and health of the rats were good; when they were fed on diets similar to those of people whose physique was bad, the physique and the health of the rats were bad; and when they were fed on diets similar to those of people whose physique were middling, the physique and health of the rats were middling." </li>

<li>Much of this internal intoxication arises from the fermentation and putrefaction of incompletely digested carbohydrates, sugar and white flour foods which are the chief trouble makers where skin diseases are concerned. </li>
<li>Beauty conscious women will be delighted to know that compatible eating also ensures a beautiful and flawless complexion. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>ARTHRITIS.</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Arthritis responds to nutritional treatment as surely as do other degenerative diseases. Most cases of arthritis are curable, and permanently so, if the disease has not progressed to such a degree that it has permanently destroyed the function of the affected joint as occurs in ankylosis. Even cases of severe arthritis, when every joint in the body is affected with pain and immobility, recover uniformly when the body is relieved of its excessive debris and feeding is corrected. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>OBESITY.</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Obesity is an evidence of an imbalance in nutrition. Its cause lies very frequently in the mixture of starch food and proteins or starches with acid fruits, and the consumption of refined carbohydrates. </li>
<li>Compatible eating is especially effective, merely avoiding warring mixtures is sufficient gradually to reduce excessive weight- without even trying to do so and without feeling hungry. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2>COMMON COLD.</h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Every cold is merely an expression of the body's effort to clean house. If the cold is evidence of body's effort to get rid of objectionable waste material that is hampering its normal functioning, then its prevention lies in the elimination of this hampering waste. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>Correct Food Combining.</b></h2>
</p>
<p>
<h2><b>PROTEIN-STARCH COMBINATIONS.</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Do not eat meat, (flesh), eggs, cheese, nuts or other protein foods at the same meal with bread, cereals, potatoes, sweet fruits, cakes etc. </li>
<li>The hamburger, egg sandwiches, cheese sandwiches, hot dogs, ham sandwiches and other such protein-starch combinations are similar dietetic abominations. </li>
<li>Digestion of carbohydrates (starches and sugars) and of protein is so different, that when they are mixed in the stomach they interfere with the digestion of each other. An acid process (gastric digestion) and an alkaline process (salivary digestion) cannot be carried on at the same time in an ideal way in the stomach. In fact, they cannot proceed together at all for long as the rising acidity of the stomach contents soon completely stops carbohydrate digestion and this is followed by fermentation. </li>
<li>Beans contain about 25% protein and about 50% carbohydrates or starch. These doubtless accounts for their difficult digestion and the readiness with which they ferment. Beans are a bread and meat combination and each of their two principle constituents requires entirely different processes for digestion. </li>
<li>The starch of the bean lies in the stomach while its protein is being digested, and except under the most favorable circumstances, ferments, producing gas and toxins. As a rule, avoid all beans. This does not include green beans which contain little starch. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>ACID-STARCH COMBINATIONS.</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Never eat carbohydrate foods and acid foods at the same time. Do not eat bread, potatoes, or peas or beans or bananas or dates or other carbohydrates with lemons, limes, oranges, grape-fruits, pineapples, tomatoes, berries, sour apples, sour grapes, or other sour fruit. A weak acid will destroy the ptyalin enzyme of the saliva. With the destruction of the ptyalin starch digestion must come to a halt. </li>
<li>Take a tomato sandwich as an example. Tomatoes should never be combined with any starch food. They may be eaten with leafy vegetables and fat foods. The combination of citric, malic and oxalic acids found in tomatoes (which is released and intensified by cooking) is very antagonistic to the alkaline digestion of starches in the mouth and the stomach. Oxalic acid diluted to 1 part in 10 000 completely arrests the action of ptyalin. There is sufficient acetic acid in one or two teaspoonfuls of vinegar to entirely suspend salivary digestion. The acids of tomatoes, oranges, grapefruits, lemons, pineapples, sour apples and other sour fruits are sufficient to destroy the ptyalin of the saliva and suspend starch digestion. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>STARCH-SUGAR COMBINATIONS.</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Ptyalin has no action upon sugar. When sugar is eaten there is a copious flow of saliva, but it contains no ptyalin. Sugars undergo no digestion in the mouth and stomach. They are digested in the intestine. If taken alone, sugars are not held in the stomach long, but are quickly sent into the intestine. All sugars, commercial sugars, syrups, sweet fruits, honey etc.; have an inhibiting effect upon the secretion of gastric juice and upon the digestive movements of the stomach. </li>
<li>When eaten with other foods, either proteins or starches, they are held up in the stomach for a prolonged period, awaiting the digestion of the other foods. This type of eating almost guarantees acid fermentation. </li>
<li>Jellies, jams, fruit pastes, white or brown sugars, honey, molasses, syrups etc.; added to breads, pastries, cereals, potatoes etc.; produce fermentation. Millions of our people eat cereals and sugar for breakfast and suffer with sour stomach, sour eructation and other evidences of indigestion. Sweet fruits with starch also result in fermentation. Breads containing dates, raisins, figs etc are dietetic abominations. If the starch is disguise with sugar, honey syrup, jams jellies etc.; this will prevent the adaptation of the saliva to starch digestion. </li>
<li>Bread and butter taken together cause no unpleasantness, but if sugar or jam or marmalade is added trouble may follow. Mixtures of starch and sugar invite fermentation and its attendant evils. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>PROTEIN-PROTEIN COMBINATIONS.</b></h2>
</p>
<p>The strongest digestive juice will be poured out in the first hour with flesh, in the third hour with bread, in the last hour of digestion with milk. </p>
<p>Eggs receive the strongest secretion at a different time to that received by either flesh or milk. In our eating practices we habitually ignore such facts. Eggs should not be taken with flesh or milk. Recall the harm that was done to tubercular patients by feeding them the abominable combination of eggs and milk. </p>
<p>Such protein combinations as flesh and eggs, flesh and nuts, flesh and cheese, eggs and milk, flesh and milk, eggs and nuts, cheese and nuts, milk and nuts etc., should not be taken. One protein food at a meal will certainly assure greater efficiency in digestion. </p>
<p>
<h2><b>ACID-PROTEIN COMBINATION. </b></h2>
</p>
<p>Do not eat acid fruits with proteins. Oranges, tomatoes, lemons, pineapples, etc. should not be eaten with meat, eggs, cheese or nuts.</p>
<p>
<h2><b>SUGAR-PROTEIN COMBINATION. </b></h2>
</p>
<p>Eat sugars and proteins at separate meals. When combined with other foods, either protein or starches, sugars are held up in the stomach for a prolonged period, awaiting the digestion of the other foods, and they undergo fermentation.<p>
<p>
<h2><b>TAKE MILK ALONE. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Due to its protein and fat (cream) content, milk combines poorly with most foods. It will combine fairly well with acid fruits. </li>
<li>In feeding milk to young children, a fruit meal may be fed and then half an hour afterwards milk may be given. The milk should not be given with the fruits, except in the case of acid fruits. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b>MILK AND CEREALS. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>A dish of boiled oat-meal, to which has been added milk and sugar, is one of the worst abominations that ever slipped down the human throat. </li>
<li>Flaked cereal foods (various types of corn flakes and other such foods) are much in use. Chemical analysis shows them to be possessed of abundant food value, though actually, they are largely charcoal. </li>
<li>They are said to be ready-cooked and pre-digested. This is a fallacy that the public must outgrow. They are pressed between rollers at intense heat and are rendered practically valueless as foods. </li> 
<li>Wheat is the most acid- forming of the cereals. Oats seem to have the worst effect on the teeth. </li>
<li>Denatured cereals with pasteurised milk and white sugar are a predominantly acid forming breakfast, a horrible combination, and plenty of sickness as a result. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> BREAD. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>We know that too much bread, if taken alone, will break down one's health. Made of cereals, largely of denatured cereals, mixed with salt, soda, yeast, lard and often other ingredients and subjected to a high degree of temperature in cooking, and then eaten three or four times a day in considerable quantities, mixed indiscriminately with all classes of foods, and taken in addition to much other starch food, bread is one of our chief sources of woe. </li>
<li>But the combination of bread and meat causes even more trouble. Such a diet, when fed to experimental animals resulted in high blood pressure, Bright's disease and troubles which usually accompany these conditions in man. Neither do the animals grow as they should. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> POTATOES. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Cereal starches require from eight to twelve times as long to digest as does potato starch. </li>
<li>Two full hours are required to digest the starch of wheat, corn and rice, and eighty minutes to digest the starch of oats, whereas the same amount of potato starch digests in ten minutes. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> VEGETARIANS. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Cereal and farinaceous foods form the basis of the diet of so-called "vegetarians' who are not guided by any direct principle, except that they believe it is wrong to eat animal food. For this reason vegetarians enjoy no better health, and live no longer than those around them. Vegetarians are usually great eaters of cereals. In fact they would receive less harm from moderate amounts of meat. </li>
<li>Never before in history have as much cereals and refined flour been consumed since the perfection of the rolling mill process in 1879. </li>
<li>The continuous struggle with indigestible food mixtures and with the poisonous products of their bacterial decomposition sooner or later wears out the body. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> Canned Foods- Processed Foods. </b></h2>
</p>
<p>
<h2><b>Balance between Space and Time Potassium and Sodium. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Space elements in foods convert to energy while the Time elements in foods convert to substance. Sodium is the most Time of the elements used in nutrition, while Potassium is the most Space of the elements used in nutrition.</li>
<li>Canned (tinned), processed and cooked foods decrease the ability to produce energy and increase the ability to produce substance. In other words, substance tends to make a person both sluggish and fat. In addition to this, Canning, processing and cooking reduces their vitamin contents and their enzymes are partially destroyed. This is a far cry from the balanced product turned out by nature.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h2><b> Conclusions regarding Potassium losses in canned foods: </b></h2>
  </p>
  <p><ol>
  <li>47 per cent in spinach, </li>
  <li>51 per cent in tomatoes, </li>
  <li>60 per cent in green beans, </li>
  <li>65 per cent in carrots, </li>
  <li>66 per cent in peas. </li>
  </ol></p>
  <p>
  <h2><b> At the same time Sodium increased by: </b></h2>
  </p>
  <p><ol>
  <li>357 per cent in spinach, </li> 
  <li>368 percent in carrots, </li>
  <li>450 per cent in tomatoes, </li>
  <li>1421 per cent in peas, </li>
  <li>5857 per cent in asparagus, </li>
  <li>45,554 per cent in green beans. </li>
  </ol></p>
  <p>
  <h2><b> Researchers reached similar conclusions. </b></h2>
  </p>
  <p>Take beets. Canning them increased the Sodium content from 60 milligrams per 10 grams to 236 milligrams and decreased the Potassium content from 335 milligrams to 167 milligrams.</p>

          <li>The way these two elements naturally occurred in raw foods was a perfect illustration of the balance between Space and Time and was obviously designed by nature to provide maximum benefit for animal life, since all animal life fed on natural fruits, vegetables, and cereals and was never fat and was never sick. </li>
          <li>If you ate canned, processed or cooked foods, you were putting into your stomach a product that was greatly altered from the way it was originally produced by nature. </li>
          <li>A diet of processed foods, even though supplemented with essential nutrients, produced deficiencies of Potassium in humans. Such persons developed listlessness, fatigue, gas pains, constipation, insomnia, low blood sugar. Muscles became soft and flabby; pulse weak, slow, and irregular. </li>
          <li>These symptoms are suffered by millions of people. It is difficult to imagine how such deficiencies could occur when Potassium was supplied in all raw, natural foods. </li>
          <li>But people were now eating relatively few fruits and vegetables, the richest source. Moreover, when vegetables are soaked and boiled and the water discarded, the Potassium was thrown away. </li>
          <li>Medications such as ACTH, Cortisones, and diuretics cause Potassium to be excreted in the urine, as did Aspirin and many other drugs, including alcohol.
          <li>Potassium could be obtained naturally from fruits, vegetables, whole grain cereals, nuts, sunflower seeds etc. </li>
          <li>High blood pressure, usually caused by an excessive sodium intake, had also been produced in both animals and humans by diets deficient in Potassium. High blood pressure also had been successfully treated by giving patient large amount of Potassium. </li>
          <li>Researchers who had spent years researching the relationship of Sodium intake to high blood pressure, had found in all age groups that the greater the sodium intake, the earlier and more numerous were deaths from hypertension. </li>
          <li>The high sodium contents of prepared baby foods were an especial target of Researchers. By feeding baby rat’s canned meats and canned vegetables prepared for infants, he produced high blood pressure that was fatal in four months. </li>
          <li>The greatest harm done by Potassium deficiency was probably its effect upon the heart. It has long been known that heart attacks were often associated with low blood potassium and a low potassium diet. </li>
          <li>In addition, experiments had shown that animals deficient in potassium suffered extensive degeneration of the heart muscles, and suffered from liver disturbances. </li>
          <li>Whenever potassium in the cells was low, blood sugar was low. Low blood sugar or hypoglycemia has become a major health problem in modern societies, causing fatigue, irritability, and foggy thinking. </li>
          <li>Low blood sugar caused still more potassium to be excreted in the urine. Then the eating of high sodium foods resulted in both potassium in the blood decreasing and blood sugar dropping, bringing a feeling of exhaustion. </li>
          <li>Since lack of potassium allowed sodium and water to pass into the cells, increasing the potassium intake often corrected edema or water retention. </li>
          <li>Weight conscious women, wishing to be quickly rid of every excess pound, begged physicians for "water pills" Though the urine output was temporarily increased and pounds lost, the cells again retained water because of an even more serious lack of potassium. </li>
          <li>Blood sugar then dropped until exhaustion became unbearable. These made nerves tense and sleep evasive. Millions of women were caught in this vicious circle. </li>
          <li>Researchers explained that cancer cells thrive in a sodium condition and die in a condition of live oxygen enzymes and potassium. </li>
          <li>Americans spent more than 200 million dollars each year for pills to make them sleep, more millions to wake them up. More than 20 million tons of aspirin are consumed each year. Pills by the tons to alleviate constipation, to reduce weight, pills to improve the appetite, pills to cut down the appetite, pills to pep you up, pills to calm you down, pills to break the habit of taking pills. </li>
          <li>Modern medicine has degenerated into a state of "pill prescribing". It has become so fragmented with so many specialists in so many areas of the human body that a patient can no longer find his way through the maze, and hospitals and medical services were pricing themselves out of reach. Why such chaos in modern countries of brilliant materialistic and technical achievements? </li>
          <li>Quantity and quality prompted thought processes in modern consumer oriented societies, so the fruits, vegetables and grains of nature were sprayed, cooked, mashed, mixed, injected with preservatives, dyed, boxed, canned, frozen, tinned and moved out to the consumer by the ton. Not only was their nutritional value thus put in question but their freedom from poisons as well. </li>
          <li>Perhaps the greatest harm done by excessive sodium intake was that it caused serious loss of potassium from the body. </li>
          <li>Potassium by activating many enzymes was essential for muscle contractions. Potassium heals and invigorates and stimulates the liver, sends messages through nervous system. Potassium is strongly alkaline. It makes tissues elastic, muscles supple and creates grace, beauty and good disposition. </li>
          <li>Without potassium, sugar (glucose) could not be changed into energy or stored for future use. Potassium stayed inside the cells and was balanced by sodium outside the cells. If potassium was deficient, however, sodium entered the cells, taking with it so much water that many cells burst. The result was water retention edema, damage to muscle and connective tissue, and scarring. </li>
          <li>It is important to remember, however, that sodium, in proper balance with potassium is essential to life and health. Sodium aids digestion and is also described as youth maintainer in the body. Sodium seems to be the conductor of electric currents inside the body’s nerve cells. </li>
          <li>Nature’s way of perfect health was fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, cereal greens- a vast array of variety and taste, regular storehouse of health, energy and vitality, a golden door to a vigorous life. </li>
          <li>Mind was Space and body was Time. When correct balance existed between them there also existed perfect health. </li>
          <li>If a diet was too Time (many processed foods and animal products), it produced a Time imbalance in the person. He or she tended to put on weight, and his or her consciousness became overly materialistic. </li>
          <li>When a diet was too Space (overly weighted with carbohydrates), it produced Space imbalance in the person. He tended to become too thin, and his consciousness became overly spiritual. </li>
          <li>Diet, then, could be a powerful force for the elevation of consciousness, but it also could be a powerful force for the lowering of consciousness. Balance was the key to a healthy mind in a healthy body. The lives of saints and Rishis indicated that they had lived on such a diet. </li>

          <h2>Oxidation</h2>
          </p>
          <p>Foods have been defined as oxidizable substances. Oxidation is the union of oxygen with another element. Oxidation may take place slowly or rapidly. Rapid oxidation is the process known as burning. </p>
          <p><ul>
          <li>Oxidation of foods takes place more rapidly at a high temperature, as in cooking, and more slowly at lower temperatures. Foods also oxidize at room temperature. When we peel an apple and slice it so that we admit the oxygen of the air to its inner structure, it soon turns brown. </li>
          <li>This same thing happens when we peel and slice a peach or banana. When foods have been oxidized they are no longer serviceable as food. </li>
          <li>The more oxidation has taken place in a food the less food value it has. Nature protects the vital structures of plants and animals from oxidation by surrounding them with structures –skins, barks, etc. </li>
          <li>When foods are sliced, diced, cut, mashed, shredded or otherwise broken into small bits, and their inner structures are subjected to contact with the air, they undergo oxidation. </li>
          <li>The finer they are grated or sliced, the thinner the slices, the more of their inner structures come into contact with oxygen, hence the more oxidation they undergo. The longer these sliced, cut and shredded foods are permitted to stand before they are eaten the more oxidation they undergo. </li>
          <li>Nuts that are ground in making nut butters, milk that is sprayed in the process of drying (dehydration), juices that are extracted from fruits and vegetables, are all permitted to come in contact with oxygen and undergo more or less oxidation in the process. </li>
          <li>It will be noticed that in nature milk flows directly from the producer to the consumer without coming in contact with the air. In this state, the milk has an entirely different flavor than it has after it has been in contact with the air for some time. Apples and peaches taste differently after oxidizing. Nut butters do not taste like nuts. Foods lose both food value and palatability from oxidation. </li>
          <li>When fresh fruits and vegetables are chopped into small pieces, or when tomatoes are sliced thin, there is rapid oxidation of vitamin c. For example, when lettuce is shredded it loses eighty per cent of its vitamin c in one minute. The loss is almost as rapid in tomatoes when these are sliced thin. </li>
          <li>The same thing is true of the vitamin c in oranges, cabbages and other fruits and vegetables. Ripe tomatoes seem to lose vitamin c less rapidly than do the green ones when they are sliced. In all green leafy vegetables, the destruction of vitamin c by oxidation, when these are chopped or shredded, is marked. The mere act of grating raw apples or raw potatoes causes a complete loss of vitamin c. </li>
          <li>Thus it will be seen that one may buy vitamin rich foods and then prepare them in such ways as to lose most of their vitamins. The grating of salads is destructive of food value. The widespread practice of making fruit and vegetable juices and drinking these also permits of great losses of food values. </li>
          <li>It will always be best to take our foods whole or if they must be cut, cut them in large pieces. There will some loss, even in this way, but the loss will be insignificant when compared with the loss that occurs when for example cabbage is shredded. </li>
          <li>Much of the damage done to food by cooking is due to oxidation- heat being the catalytic agent in this instance. It was early discovered that the application of heat to foods destroyed vitamins. </li>
          <li>Even comparatively low temperatures, such as that used in pasteurizing milk, are enough to destroy many of the vitamins of foods. Cooking destroys in part, if not wholly, the oxidizable factors of foods. </li>
          <li>This simply means that cooking "burns" those portions of foods that the body ordinarily oxidizes. Once these substances have been oxidized, they cannot again be oxidized in the body hence they are useless as food. </li>
          <li>Heat by speeding up oxidation turns food into ashes before it is eaten. </li>
          <li>For example, certain of the amino acids are destroyed by the regular processes of cooking. Two very important amino acids, Lysine and Glutamine are destroyed by the cooking process. </li>
          <li>The losses that are produced by cooking may not result in serious trouble until later in life and all of their effects do not show up for two or three generations.  </li>
          <li>For example those cats fed on pasteurized milk and cooked flesh could not reproduce after two to three generations. They usually died of arthritis, heart diseases or gastro-intestinal complications. </li>
          <li>It is significant that when researches had fed their cats on cooked foods for a few generations, they not only developed many very serious defects, including finally, loss of ability to reproduce, but they also became homosexual and lost their normal endowments of hereditary racial sex characteristics. </li>
          <li>Some day, perhaps, we may know just how much similar eating practices have to do with the growing alikeness of the sexes in country (USA). Tests have shown that with large numbers of boys and girls, it is impossible to tell them apart by their anatomical differences of height, shoulder and hip dimensions, etc. Viewed nude from the rear, they were identical in appearance. Accompanying this wiping out of distinguishing sexual differences, there is the growing increase of sterility in both sexes. </li>
          </ul></p>
          <p>
          <h2><b> The loss of minerals from foods in the process of cooking is of three kinds, </b></h2>
          </p>
          <p><ol>
          <li>There is the leaching of minerals from the foods as these run out into the water in which they are cooked, or as they run out into the pan in the juices of the food. When foods are boiled their mineral losses are great, more so if they are cut up before boiling. </li>
          <li>There is the evaporation of some of the minerals, as for example, the evaporation of iodine. In the process of pasteurizing milk, twenty per cent of the iodine content of the milk is lost by volatilization. Sulfur is lost from cabbage and onions in the process of cooking. </li>
          <li>There is the alteration of some of the salts of foods, so that they are no longer usable by the body. An excellent example of this is the change that occurs in the calcium and phosphorus in milk in the process of pasteurization. </li>
          </ol></p>
          <p><ul>
          <li>It used to be asserted by advocates of cooking that heat bursts open the membranes or capsules that enclose the starch and other nutrients of vegetables, and thus renders them more susceptible of digestion. </li>
          <li>This was particularly thought to be so with regard to the starches of cereals, legumes, and potatoes. Raw starch was thought to be almost indigestible. </li>
          <li>The researchers of Strasburg and Heupke in Europe and of Hastings in America have shown this supposition to be incorrect. </li>
          <li>Indeed, the digestive juices digest the unboiled or uncooked vegetable cells as readily, or more so, as the cooked ones. </li>
          <li>Viewed from every angle, the application of intense heat to foods constitutes a great waste of nutrients. The enzymes in foods, the roles of which in human nutrition are not yet fully understood, are also destroyed by heat. </li>
          <li>Let us look at milk again. Pasteurizing milk destroys the following enzymes contained in the milk: Protease, Lactase, Diastase, Lipase, Salolalase, Catalase, Peroxides, Aldehydrase, Amylase and Phosphates. It greatly impairs the value of chlorophyll and spoils the iron salts in foods. </li>
          <li>Animal feeding tests indicate that the regular processing of cooking reduce the nutritional value of food by at least one third, thus lending strength to the statement that we are nourished by the uncooked and but partially cooked portions of our foods and made sick by the thoroughly cooked portions. </li>
          <li>By now it should be evident that the chefs and the mistresses of the kitchen cannot be trusted with our physiological welfare. </li>
          <li>These turn out a never ending array of heterogeneous mixtures that tax the strongest digestions; cook our foods until they have lost the greater part of their food value, salt them, pepper them, spice them, sweeten them. Put vinegar or other such material on them to hide their insipid character and feed them to us as the finest selections from among their many choice recipes. </li>
          <li>The alien taste given to the foods by the mixings and seasonings make the adaptation of digestive juices to the digestive requirements of the foods impossible, while the near foods, tars, charcoal and ashes that constitute great part of these abominable concoctions of the kitchen are materials that should never be taken into the human stomach. </li>

            <li>It is significant that when researches had fed their cats on cooked foods for a few generations, they not only developed many very serious defects, including finally, loss of ability to reproduce, but they also became homosexual and lost their normal endowments of hereditary racial sex characteristics. </li>
            <li>Some day, perhaps, we may know just how much similar eating practices have to do with the growing alikeness of the sexes in country (USA). Tests have shown that with large numbers of boys and girls, it is impossible to tell them apart by their anatomical differences of height, shoulder and hip dimensions, etc. Viewed nude from the rear, they were identical in appearance. Accompanying this wiping out of distinguishing sexual differences, there is the growing increase of sterility in both sexes. </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>
            <h2><b> The loss of minerals from foods in the process of cooking is of three kinds, </b></h2>
            </p>
            <p><ol>
            <li>There is the leaching of minerals from the foods as these run out into the water in which they are cooked, or as they run out into the pan in the juices of the food. When foods are boiled their mineral losses are great, more so if they are cut up before boiling. </li>
            <li>There is the evaporation of some of the minerals, as for example, the evaporation of iodine. In the process of pasteurizing milk, twenty per cent of the iodine content of the milk is lost by volatilization. Sulfur is lost from cabbage and onions in the process of cooking. </li>
            <li>There is the alteration of some of the salts of foods, so that they are no longer usable by the body. An excellent example of this is the change that occurs in the calcium and phosphorus in milk in the process of pasteurization. </li>
            </ol></p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>It used to be asserted by advocates of cooking that heat bursts open the membranes or capsules that enclose the starch and other nutrients of vegetables, and thus renders them more susceptible of digestion. </li>
            <li>This was particularly thought to be so with regard to the starches of cereals, legumes, and potatoes. Raw starch was thought to be almost indigestible. </li>
            <li>The researchers of Strasburg and Heupke in Europe and of Hastings in America have shown this supposition to be incorrect. </li>
            <li>Indeed, the digestive juices digest the unboiled or uncooked vegetable cells as readily, or more so, as the cooked ones. </li>
            <li>Viewed from every angle, the application of intense heat to foods constitutes a great waste of nutrients. The enzymes in foods, the roles of which in human nutrition are not yet fully understood, are also destroyed by heat. </li>
            <li>Let us look at milk again. Pasteurizing milk destroys the following enzymes contained in the milk: Protease, Lactase, Diastase, Lipase, Salolalase, Catalase, Peroxides, Aldehydrase, Amylase and Phosphates. It greatly impairs the value of chlorophyll and spoils the iron salts in foods. </li>
            <li>Animal feeding tests indicate that the regular processing of cooking reduce the nutritional value of food by at least one third, thus lending strength to the statement that we are nourished by the uncooked and but partially cooked portions of our foods and made sick by the thoroughly cooked portions. </li>
            <li>By now it should be evident that the chefs and the mistresses of the kitchen cannot be trusted with our physiological welfare. </li>
            <li>These turn out a never ending array of heterogeneous mixtures that tax the strongest digestions; cook our foods until they have lost the greater part of their food value, salt them, pepper them, spice them, sweeten them. Put vinegar or other such material on them to hide their insipid character and feed them to us as the finest selections from among their many choice recipes. </li>
            <li>The alien taste given to the foods by the mixings and seasonings make the adaptation of digestive juices to the digestive requirements of the foods impossible, while the near foods, tars, charcoal and ashes that constitute great part of these abominable concoctions of the kitchen are materials that should never be taken into the human stomach. </li>

            </p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>That a diet of fruits, nuts and green vegetables, to the exclusion of all animal foods, will suffice to sustain life, health and growth in human beings after the suckling period is past admits of no doubt. </li>
            <li>Whole tribes have lived on such for generations and demonstrated this to be so. </li>

            <li>It requires much material to construct and complete a building but after it is completed it may be kept in repair with but small amounts of materials. Just so it is with the human body. </li>
            <li>After complete physical maturity is reached and growth has ceased, one’s food requirements are very different to what they were in youth. As age advances it is usually best to decrease the amount of food consumed daily. </li>
            <li>The diet of maturity should then contain but little protein. The diet should contain an abundance of those food elements so essential to normal elimination and normal secretions – the organic salts. </li>
            <li>This is imperative if one is to maintain health, strength and youth. These keep the body sweet and clean and ward off those disagreeable and annoying symptoms and disorders that usually accompany ‘old age’. </li>

            <h2><b> Diet of Elimination. </b></h2>
            </p>
            <p><ul>
            <li>Orthodox science considers foods to be ‘nutritious’ and ‘non-nutritious’ according as they yield much or little nitrogenous, carbohydrate and hydrocarbon substances. </li>
            <li>In keeping with this idea foods are classified as </li>
            <p><ol>
            <li>Proteins, </li>
            <li>Carbohydrates </li>

            <li>The wonderful vitalizing acid (organic acids) and salts, which they contain, are relegated to the ‘ash’ column and practically ignored. </li>
            <li>The conventional diet is more or less deficient in alkali elements due to the fact that it is made up largely of the concentrated proteins, carbohydrates and hydrocarbons, and to the further fact that these have usually been deprived of most of their alkaline elements in the process of manufacture and cooking. </li>
            <li>Practically all the ‘staple’ articles of food used today show a relative predominance of acid forming over base-forming elements. </li>
            <li>In disease, the process of growth, development and repair are slackened or stopped altogether, indicating that the body is in no condition to properly care for the normal amounts of proteins, starches, etc. and we find by actual experience that when these are eliminated from the diet of the sick they immediately begin to improve in health. </li>
            <li>On the other hand those patients that consume the protein and carbohydrate foods always improve very slowly, if at all. </li>
            <li>True eliminating diet is one that is rich in mineral salts and lacking in the acid forming proteins and carbohydrates. The base-forming elements must greatly predominate in such a diet. </li>

            <h2>Microwave Oven Milk Reheated in microwave ovens could damage baby’s brains.</h2>
            </p>
            <p><ul>.
            <li>London. - Milk reheated in microwave ovens could damage baby's brains, scientists say, because rapid reheating can turn harmless milk proteins into poisons. And adults could be at risk from the same poisons when food such as pizzas, curries and quiches are recooked. </li>
            <li>The warning comes from a respected team of Viennese researchers led by Dr.Gerd Lubec. </li>
            <li>They say microwaves can turn milk proteins into a variation of amino Acids, which the bodies of young babies cannot absorb. The report warns of Microwave Poison Risk. </li>
            <li>Micro waved Food caries a higher risk of food poisoning than conventionally cooked meals. </li>
            <li>Yet in spite of the use of a microwave in nearly half of all British Households, 97% of people are unaware of the potential health risk, says Report in the Food Magazine. </li>
            <li>Microwave cooking is less efficient than conventional ovens in destroying Salmonella and Listeria, and in the case of cook-chill meals, manufacturers' recommended cooking periods may not be adequate. </li>
            <li>Bacteria: The Magazine quotes research in the United States which discovered that the Microwaving of Salmonella infected Chicken, following Manufacturers' cooking instructions, was unable to destroy contamination in eight out of nine cases. </li>
            <li>Similar research carried out earlier this year by Leeds University discovered that Microwaving was unable to destroy Listeria Bacteria in five of the twenty-seven contaminated dishes that were cooked. </li> 
            <li>The magazine now believes that the department of Health's guidance that Micro waved Food is safe if reheated to 70 degree for at least two minutes is wrong. In the Leeds study, temperatures of 91 degree were required to kill Listeria. </li>
            <li>Although the Report falls short of saying Microwaving is intrinsically dangerous, it believes that misleading instructions for precooked food, together with insufficient understanding of how the microwaving process works, are responsible for a high proportion of food poisoning cases in the home and in catering establishments. </li>
            <li>The Microwave Association, which believes that more than 70% of households will have a microwave within year or two, is also concerned. </li>
            <li>Mrs. Gina Field, spokesman for the Association said: "Allowing food to stand after cooking is vital, but often ignored. If cook-chill food is contaminated, microwaving will not kill the bugs. </li>
            <li>We are also very alarmed at reports that small commercial caterers are using domestic microwave ovens to cook for hordes of people. </li>
            <li>Domestic size ovens are not designed for constant use and will become less effective if they are used repeatedly. </li>
            </ul></p>
            <p>
            <h2>Nutrition</h2>
</p>
<p><ul>

<li>What constitutes nutrition? Certainly the common thought that food and nutrition is the same thing is a fallacy that needs to be discarded. It is one thing to eat an abundance of good food; it is quite another thing to have good nutrition. </li>
<li>Food is one of the materials with which the processes of nutrition are carried on. Water is another, and air is another. But neither one of these, nor all of them combined constitutes nutrition. </li>
<li>Nutrition is a vital process carried on only by a living organism. It is a process of growth, development and invigoration. </li>
<li>To eat good food, to drink pure water and breathe pure air are very desirable. But something more is needed in order to acquire health, strength and vigour. </li>
<li>Nutrition is function and we can have better nutritive function only when we have the capacity for better nutrition. Capacity cannot be bought. </li>
<li>There are no drugs in the drug stores that can increase capacity, nor can they carry on the functions of life for us. The power to live, to breathe, to eat, to function resides within not without. </li>
<li>Food is of value only in its physiological connections with air, water, sunshine, rest and sleep, exercise and activity, cleanliness and wholesome mental and moral influences. In short, all the natural or normal circumstances, which we know to be necessary for preservation of health. It would be impossible to assign to any over the rest a superior value, the simple fact being that each is indispensable and it is only in their plenary combination and harmonious co-adaptation to the wants of the body that real health is maintained or regained, once it has been lost. </li>
<li>They constitute not only the only means that the powers of life can make use of in the preservation of health, but also all that they can use in restoring health. They are nature’s only remedial means. </li>
<li>Food is inert substance and therefore has no power to make living organisms. It cannot act, but is acted upon. The living organism uses what it can of the food consumed and rejects the rest. </li>
<li>A large supply of food does not increase the digestive and assimilative capacity of the invalid. </li>
<li>Instead of studying nature and her laws, with the idea of using her laws, conditions and materials constructively, we seem to study her in an effort to discover how to cheat her. We seek not to obey the laws of life but to disobey them. </li>
<li>Often it is important to know what not to do as to know what to do. Thousands of patients are killed yearly and many thousands more are irreparably injured because their physicians do not know what not to do. </li>
<li>There are times when one should not eat; there are conditions under which no food should be taken. It is not what one eats that invigorates one, but what one digests and appropriates; hence to know how to improve digestion and assimilation is of more importance than to know what foods to feed. </li>
<li>When you live on 100 per cent natural food, you build health every day of your life. You will get a better intellect, a stronger nervous system, a more powerful body and an excellent character, because you will be free from disease, pollution and evil. Then naturally and easily, comes the true beauty of life: power to love others. Nothing will build better morals, stronger character, bigger and tenderer hearts, than the natural way of living. </li>

<h2>The poisons in your food (Food Additives)</h2>
</p>
<p>
<h2><b>Food Dyes</b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul> 
<li>These are synthetic dyes put together by man and are mostly coal-tar products. </li>
<li>The majority of synthetic dyes approved for use in foods have been shown to cause cancer in animals; among them are chemical cousins to highly potent cancer-causing substances that actually have caused cancer in man. </li>
<li>Some dyes, though not carcinogenic (cancer causing), are harmful to animals, even in tiny doses; on different occasions large numbers of children have been made violently sick from eating artificially colored foods. </li>
<li>Dyes appear in everything from sweet potatoes to frankfurters. They are used in some processed breakfast cereals and in flavored straws designed to beguile children into drinking their milk. </li>
<li>Dyes are used as coloring matter in many household detergents; these dyes come from a chemical family that has produced cancers in rats. </li>
<li>In an experiment, ten out of thirteen synthetic coal-tar dyes, certified for use by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in the USA, and all in wide use, were tested. </li>
<li>They produced cancers in rats when injected under the skin. Science writer Earl Ubell estimated that some people must get twice as much by mouth as some of the rats got under the skin. </li>
<li>The oil-soluble colors reportedly were in general so poisonous when injected under the skin that the mice died before the scientists had a chance to see if cancer developed in many cases. </li>
<li>Cancer researchers have noted that carcinogens may start cancers even when not absorbed in the intestinal tract but merely by contact. </li>
<li>The length of exposure to unabsorbed carcinogens- such as some of the certified food dyes- may depend on a person's state of health, diet, how long the food remains in the digestive tract and many other factors over which the average individual has little or no control. </li>
<li>The cumulative, irreversible effects of carcinogens always should be borne in mind; once they appear in foods, the damage cannot be undone by removing them. </li>
<li>Discontinuation of the use of such dyes offers no assurance that it will not cause cancer years later in children who have already eaten it. </li>
<li>The threat to children is repeatedly stressed because of the number of years they have ahead of them after they get their doses of these dyes. </li>
<li>The dyes make it possible for the public to be deceived and cheated by masking inferior products and creating nutritional illusions, and they are among the most poisonous chemicals that go into foods. </li>
<li><b>FACTS:</b> USA: 200 children were made ill from eating dyed popcorn at a Christmas party. The FDA announced decertification of the three dyes involved: Red no.32, Orange 1, and Orange 2.In announcing the ban, the FDA told food and beverage manufacturers they could legally use up previously certified stocks of the colors, but cautioned them that foods containing excessive quantities of these colors "can cause illness to consumers." </li>
<li>The list of damages caused in animals by the three dyes reads like a catalogue of biological horrors- and the amounts used were small (100milligrams weighs about the same as two postage stamps). The dyes caused everything from loss of appetite to death. </li>
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Red no.32 was fed to rats at a level of 2.0 per cent of the diet. </li>
<li>All the rats died within a week. </li> 
<li>At a 1.0 per cent level, death occurred within 12 days. </li>
<li>At 0.5 per cent most of the rats died within 26 days. </li>
<li>At 0.25 per cent approximately half of the rats died within 3 months. </li>
<li>All the rats showed marked retardation and anaemia. </li> 
<li>Autopsy revealed moderate to marked liver damage, enlargement of the right side of the heart. </li>
</ol></p>
<p>
<li>Tests on Orange no.1 were similar to those of Red no. 32. Red no. 32 had been used to color cheese, edible fats, oils, candy (sweets), bakery goods and the skins of oranges. Florida and Texas orange growers insisted that if they waited for their fruit to turn orange it would be overripe and ruined. </li>
<li>An industry spokesman said that more than half the Florida orange crops was run through a dye bath to give green oranges an orange color; although it was conceded that orange peels are used in many ways: as candied orange peel, marmalade, in drinks as slices, and extensively in baking cakes and icings. </li>
<li>No color can be added to a green skinned orange. First it has to be "degree Ned". This is done in what is known as the "coloring room", where it is shut up air-tight and then doused with a gas. </li> 
<li>The gas now universally used is ethylene gas (which can cause asphyxiation). This gas destroys or removes the chlorophyll from the rind and leaves it, according to the degree of greenness, all the way from a sickly or lemon color to almost white. I have seen them come out of the coloring room looking almost like peeled potatoes. </li>
<li>While it is being gassed, the fruit is subjected to artificial heat and is sometimes held in this room for three or four days. It impairs its flavor and has a tendency to hasten its deterioration and decay. After coming out of the coloring room the fruit is washed and then run through the "color added" machine- that is, if they want it to have any extra color. The color is added by passing the fruit through a vat or bath of hot dye or else spraying it on hot while the fruit is subjected to steam heat. </li>
<li>Practically all of the Florida citrus that goes to market through regular commercial channels before the first of the year is artificially colored. </li>
<li>The international Union against Cancer said that not one dye had been proved safe for use in food. The cancer experts listed twenty-nine food dyes as unsuitable and potentially dangerous. Some of these dyes and foods they appear in are listed below: </li>
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Orange no. 1- Fish pastes, carbonated beverages (cold-drinks),jellies, confectionery, custard, blanc-mange powder, biscuits, cakes, ice-cream, cordials, ice cream toppings, milk syrups, sausages, casings, puddings, frozen desserts, soft drinks, solutions for home use. </li>
<li>Orange no.2 - Cheese, margarine, candies, edible fats, external coloring of oranges. </li>
<li>Yellow no. 1 - Confectionery, macaroni, spaghetti, other pastas, baked goods, beverages. </li>
<li>Yellow no. 3 - (Yellow AB)- Edible fats, margarine, butter, cakes, biscuits, candies. </li>
<li>Green no.1 - Cordials, jelly, soft drinks, candy, bakery goods, frozen desserts. </li>
<li>Blue no.1 - Icings, cordials, jellies, ice cream, ice cream toppings, milk syrups, candies, cake decorations, frozen desserts, soft drinks, puddings, bakery goods, solutions for home use. </li>

<p>
<li>Dyes are added to Tandoori chickens to enhance eye appeal. </li>
<li>Baby foods are flavored, salted and colored with food dye to appeal to adult tastes, not child needs. </li>
<li>Unscrupulous traders are adding red dye to red chili powder. </li>
</ul></p>
 <p>
<h2><b>Antioxidants. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li> <b>BHT</b> (butylated hydroxytoluene) and <b>BHA</b> (butylated hydroxyanisole) are petroleum products that have come into widespread use as antioxidants in foods. </li>
<li> Natural antioxidants, which delay rancidity, are lost during the factory processing of refined oils and fats. BHT and BHA are used to restore the anti oxidation qualities. Most of these added materials with antioxidant properties are known to be toxic and are also considered by some authorities as possible cancer-inciters. </li>
<li> At first they were used with fats, but later they were incorporated so extensively in other items that today you can scarcely find in your shopping basket any factory-processed food or food packaging material that does not contain one or both of these chemicals. </li>
<li> Various experiments have demonstrated damaging effects of <b>BHT</b> in test animals, including metabolic stress, depression of the growth rate, loss of weight, damage to the liver, increase of serum cholesterol, baldness, and foetal abnormalities. </li>
<li> Both <b>BHT</b> and <b>BHA</b> have been demonstrated as harmful, and in sensitive individuals they produce more severe reactions. </li>
<li> <b>BHT</b> and <b>BHA</b> may be incorporated in food-packaging materials, and in animal feeds, as well as in ingredients used for food-stuffs, they can enter the end product indirectly. </li>
<li> Even if <b>BHA</b> and/or <b>BHT</b> added to a food, the consumer may not necessarily find them listed specifically. The FDA and the USDA allow the general terms "freshness preserver," "antioxidant added," or similar phrases to appear on the label, which give no clue to the exact material used. Is it <b>BHA? </b><b>BHT? </b> Propyl gallate? Octyl Gallate? NDGA? Or some other antioxidant officially sanctioned? </li>
<li> In some quarters, officials have taken measures to restrict the use of these antioxidants. BHT was deleted from the list of permitted food additives in Sweden and banned in Rumania for use in foods. In Australia, where much of the <b>BHT</b> research has been conducted by the Commonwealth Antioxidant research Project, the substance has not been included in the government's list of permitted antioxidants. </li>
<li> <b>BHT/BHA</b> manufacturers suggest their use in animal fats such as lard, beef tallow, bacon, chicken fat, butter, cream, shortenings, and grease; fried foods such as potato chips, doughnuts, and processed meats and fish; baked foods such as crackers, pastries, cakes, candies, and cookies; vegetable fats such as shortenings, margarine, peanut butter, and salad oils and dressings; ground grain meals and grain germs; a miscellany of other food items, including nutmeats, raisins, milk, candied fruit, whipped topping mixes, imitation fruit drinks, breakfast foods, extracts, essential oils, spices, and pet foods; food packaging papers and containers such as cartons for milk; containers for cottage cheese, ice cream, potato chips, cereals, cookies, and pastries; wrappers for bread, butter and cheese; rubber gaskets that seal food jars; and household wax paper. They are also found in some beverages, chewing gum, cosmetics, drugs and animal feeds. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> Emulsifiers. </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Few chemical additives outrank the so-called emulsifiers as a bonanza to the food processor- and few are more suspect of causing damage to humans than some of those widely used compounds. </li>
<li>Emulsifiers have many uses in foods: they promote smoothness, and keep incompatible ingredients like oil and water from separating; they may also be used to give stale baked goods a deceptive appearance of freshness; and they act as substitutes for more costly and nutritious natural ingredients such as eggs, milk, butter, and vegetable shortening. </li>
<li>Some emulsifiers, in only moderate doses, have been shown to be extremely poisonous to animals; others have not been adequately tested. </li>
<li>Yet tens of millions of pounds of emulsifiers are used annually in foods. These compounds have a variety of names: softeners, surface-active agents, wetting-agents; some are very close chemically to detergents used in laundering and cleaning. </li>
<li>Two main categories of emulsifiers are used in foods. To the chemist the first is composed of mono-and diglycerides, the second of polyoxyethylene monostearate and related compounds. More familiarly, they are known as the glycerides and poly compounds. The former are artificial fats derived from glycerides; the latter are derived in part from ethylene oxide. </li>
<li>Chemicals which facilitate emulsions are the emulsifiers, but their action generally has to be supplemented with chemicals called stabilizers which prevent the emulsions from breaking down. </li>
<li>Altogether, fifty seven different chemicals are permitted as either emulsifiers or stabilizers, with E-numbers in the 300s and 400s, plus lecithin (E322). </li>
<li>It was found that when small amounts of the glyceride compounds were mixed with shortening and incorporated into baked goods their use resulted in "more tender" bread, buns, cake, and other sweet goods. </li>

<h2><b>White Bread. </b></h2>
</p>
<p>
<b>"The average loaf of commercial white bread sold today is primarily the product of chemical ingenuity, clever mechanical technology and advertising guile.It is subjected to a bombardment of chemicals, stripped of virtually all nutrients, given a few synthetic vitamins, shot with emulsifier to keep it soft and, sold to the gullible public as an enriched product."--William Long good </b>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>For more than twenty-five years bread flour was bleached and "matured" with nitrogen trichloride, a gas known as Agene. Sir Edward Mellanby, a distinguished British physician and nutritionist , discovered that dogs fed bread made with Agene treated flour developed "running fits" or "canine hysteria". Some ten years after the substance was found to be a powerful nerve poison for dogs, the use of Agene in bread making was legally banned. </li>
<li>A substitute gas was found by the flour millers. This gas is known as Chlorine Dioxide. The authoritative publication 'Lockwood's Flour Milling' has this to say about the gas: </li>
<li>"The use of Chlorine dioxide is more powerful than nitrogen trichloride (Agene); the quantities used are one- third to half those of nitrogen trichloride. </li>
<li>Chlorine dioxide not only oxidises the flour pigment but also has a valuable bleaching effect on the coloring matter of the bran, which makes it particularly valuable for bleaching low grade flours." </li>
<li>Use of chlorine dioxide was approved over the protests of many USA nutritionists. The FDA (Food and Drugs Administration of USA) lists the gas as a poisonous substance, permitting on grounds that it is 'probably safe as normally used'. </li>
<li>The late Leonard Wickenden , a noted chemist, pointed out in his book 'Our Daily Poison" that "No one has yet discovered that it gives dogs running fits so it is considered quite safe." </li>
<li>While Agene and chlorine dioxide generally are called bleaches, their primary purpose is to age flour artificially. Aging is considered necessary to give some flours the right consistency, but to avoid costly storage and waiting for the process to take place, they are given a shot of gas. </li>
<li>Samuel Lepkovsky of the College of Agriculture at the University of California in Berkley, and author of "Bread problem in war and in peace", noted that "instead of being alarmed at the decreased nutritive value of white flour as shown by the inability of insect pests to thrive on it, the production of white flour was hailed as a great forward step." </li>
<li>In milling, flour is treated with improvers, oxidizing agents such as per sulfate, bromine, iodate, and nitrogen trichloride, which affect protease activity and gluten properties. </li>
<li>Bleaching agents such as oxides of nitrogen, chlorines and benzoyl peroxide convert the yellow carotenoid pigment to colorless compounds because of alleged consumer desire for white bread. </li>
<li>An obstacle to overcome is the common belief that there is little if any nutritional difference between white and whole-wheat bread. </li>
<li>The baker is delighted to maintain this canard because white flour will keep much longer than whole-wheat. </li>
<li>Several scientists have noted that bugs avoid bleached flour because it does not have enough nutrition to keep them alive. "Only humans eat it," said Dr. Carlson. </li>
<li>Sylvester Graham said that whole-wheat bread (whole wheat is wheat ground as flour but with bran and all other substances retained in the flour) was almost a complete food and in addition could cure digestive disorders such as constipation and diarrhea. He also warned that removal of the bran by bolting or separating from the milled flour reduced the nutritive value. </li>
<li>Lepkovsky quoted a J.B. Orr as recalling that during the Napoleonic wars the men from northern England and southern Scotland who lived in the country side and had plenty of whole-wheat grain, milk, eggs and vegetables were big, powerful and energetic men who made the best infantry soldiers of Europe . During the Boer war a large percentage of the recruits from this same district were short, frail weaklings who could not be used as soldiers. </li>
<li>"A commission was appointed to investigate the cause of this striking change in the physical condition of these men, and it was found that many people who had moved off the land and had gone into the slums of the big cities had their eating habits changed. They were depending too largely on white flour and sugar".</li>
<li>Despite spirited opposition to white bread by many doctors and health officials, the milling industry laid down a massive propaganda barrage which buried its opponents. </li>
<li>Anyone who attacked the nutritive values of white bread was denounced. Industry was aided in this campaign by organized medicine and the government. "The nutritional poverty of white bread as compared with whole-wheat was so great as to demand attention".</li>
<li>This led to the fortification of white bread.To understand what is involved in fortifying bread, it is helpful to observe what happens to the grain in milling: </li>
<li>A grain of wheat or berry, as it is called, is composed of three principal parts: </li>
	</p>
	<p><ol>
<li>The outer shell or husk, </li> <li>
<li>The endosperm or kernel and </li>
<li>The germ from which the grain reproduces itself. </li>
</ol></p>
<li>When the grain is planted the husk protects the seed while it germinates, and the endosperm- a carbohydrate- feeds the germ until it gets a foothold and takes nutrients from the earth and air. </li>
<li>The modern steel flour mill is a devilishly clever device; it removes the husk and the germ of a grain of wheat, leaving only the endosperm. It is the endosperm from which flour is made. </li>
<li>The flour that emerges is little more than pure starch, containing only about seven to eleven per cent low grade protein. When mixed with water, the flour becomes an easily shaped paste. </li>
<li>The miller loves white flour because of its long-keeping qualities and unattractiveness to bugs. But a secondary attraction is that he can sell the removed bran as feed for animals, and the wheat germ as a food supplement for human beings and animals. </li>
<li>Dr.Carlson said: "It is a tragedy to me... that we mill the best of our ingredients out of our grain and that the best part is fed to hogs and cattle while we eat the poorest part." </li>
<li>In the discarded parts are nutrients essential to human health and life. Some twenty natural vitamins and minerals are removed from white bread and are replaced with four or five synthetic ones at higher cost and call the product "enriched or fortified." </li>
<li>Numerous experiments have confirmed the nutritional inadequacy of "enriched" bread compared to the whole-wheat. </li>
<li>In one experiment carried out by Dr.Estelle Howley, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Nutrition at Rochester University, one group of rats was fed "enriched" commercial white bread and another was given bread made with the Cornell formula which was formulated by Dr. Clive McCay at Cornell, consisting of unbleached flour enriched with natural food products such as wheat germ, soy-bean flour, and a high proportion of milk solids. </li>
<li>Rats on the MacCay-Cornell formula thrived, as did their offspring through the fourth generation. Rats on the commercial white bread became sickly and starved-looking and produced stunted offspring. All died off and the strain became extinct before the fourth generation. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> The Flavour Enhancers. </b></h2>
</p><p>
<h2><b> Monosodium Glutamate (MSG). </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>MSG is one of the more concentrated sources of sodium. Because of this, it could not be permitted in diets in which sodium intake must be kept low. </li>
<li>Dr. John W. Olney of the Washington University of the school of medicine in St Louis said that he believed that pregnant women should not use MSG until further data are available. </li>
<li>To determine whether MSG causes more than transitory symptoms of acute distress resembling gall-bladder trouble, epigastric fullness, marked upper-abdominal discomfort, numbness at the back of the neck, general weakness and palpitation, tightness on both sides of the head, pounding, throbbing sensation in the head, laboratory experiments were conducted where larger amounts of MSG were injected into animals. It caused brain damage in new born mice, and eye damage in new-born mice. As adults, the MSG treated animals showed stunted skeletal development, marked obesity and female sterility. </li>
<li>The FDA requested the AMA's council on Foods and Nutrition to review the subject of MSG in baby foods. </li>
<li>Dr.Olney had reported further findings. Brain lesions had in every species of experimental animals tested, including mice, rats and rabbits. The next species tested was a primate: a rhesus monkey. Dr. Olney reported that brain lesions occurred in infant rhesus monkeys. </li>
<li>It is virtually impossible to avoid MSG in processed foods. MSG is found in heat and serve convenience foods; meats, stews, and meat tenderizers; canned and frozen vegetables; sea foods, fish fillets, clam chowder, codfish cakes, canned tuna; poultry and chicken a la king; almost all canned soups and soup mixes; seasonings; mayonnaise, French dressings, salad dressings; imitation maple syrup; potato chips; crackers; tobacco; baby foods; etc. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> Saccharin an Artificial Sweetener. </b></h2>
</p>
<p>
<li>“Saccharin is a noxious drug, and even in comparatively small doses it is harmful to the human system".</li>
<li>Saccharin, a coal-tar product synthesized in 1879, is intensely sweet, cheap, and not bulky to handle. </li>
<li>Such qualities appealed to the food industry, which began to flood the market with candies (sweets), soft drinks and bakery products using saccharin as a sugar substitute. </li>
<li>"The Commission of the Health Association in France decreed saccharin harmful and forbade its manufacture or import. </li>
<li>The German government limited its use, and expressly banned it from all food and drink. Similar actions were taken in Spain, Portugal, and Hungary. But attempts to keep saccharin out of food and drink in America and elsewhere have been unsuccessful." </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
<h2><b> "MARGARINE-THE GRAND DECEPTION" </b></h2>
</p>
<p><ul>
<li>Margarine, in addition to its hydrogenation, has other objectionable features that make it an artificial product. </li>
<li>An artificial butter like flavor and odour are achieved with Diacetyl. To ensure enjoyment of these qualities, isopropyl or stearyl citrates are added. These additives are euphemistically labeled "flavor protectors”. </li>
<li>Additional attempts to achieve butter-like qualities are made with artificial color, lecithin to imitate the frying behavior of butter, and synthetic vitamins to "enrich" the product. Sodium Benzoate, benzoic acid or citric acid may be added as preservatives. </li>
<li>The benzoates are known poisons, with severe reactions in sensitive individuals, resulting occasionally in death. </li>
<li>In addition to these items, which usually appear on the label, emulsifiers (monoglycerides, diglycerides, and others) may be present but undeclared. </li>
<li>A fat is distinguished from oil by its physical consistency. At room temperature if solid, it is considered a fat; if liquid, an oil. How is the liquid oil or soft fat hardened? It is exposed to a high temperature and placed under pressure. </li>
<li>Hydrogen is then bubbled through the oil in the presence of nickel, platinum or some other catalyst. The hydrogen atoms combine with the carbon atoms, and the product becomes saturated or hardened. </li>
<li>The new compound bears no relationship to the original oil. It is dark, malodorous or foul smelling grease. It is then bleached with corrosive chemicals to finish the change from an organic to an inorganic substance; from a live to a dead concoction. </li>
<li>Technologists' skill are used to bleach, filter and deodorise it into a pure white, odorless, tasteless, highly artificial fat. It may be processed further for making shortening, lard or margarine. </li>
<li>The heating of the oil ruins its original character, with destruction of all vitamins and minerals as well as an alteration of proteins. </li>
<li>The essential fatty acids (EFA) are destroyed or changed into abnormal toxic fatty acids antagonistic to EFA...The synthetic fat forms new molecular structure unacceptable to the human physiology. </li>
<li>Dr. Hugh Sinclair at the Laboratory of Human Nutrition, Oxford University, has found that lack of EFA "is a contributory cause in neurological diseases, heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and skin disease, various degenerative conditions such as cataract, arthritis and cancer".</li>
<li>John H. Tobe, in his book "Margarine- the Plastic Fat" wrote: "Finely pulverized nickel is used in practically all processes of hydrogenation. </li>
<li>It is clearly admitted in a book entitled 'Industrial Chemistry' that all the nickel can never be filtered out no matter how hard they try. </li>
<li>A quote from this book: 'The commercial procedure is to suspend finely divided nickel in the oil heated to 250 to 300 degrees F (121 to 149 degrees C) and blow in hydrogen gas... The nickel is used in amounts of 0.5 to 1 percent of the weight of the oil'. </li>
<li>I checked further and to my utter amazement I found that the product used by the industry at large is a substance called Raney Nickel. Very few people know, but the Merck's Index reveals that Raney Nickel catalyst is prepared by fusing 50 parts nickel with 50 parts aluminum, for use as catalyst for the hydrogenation of organic compounds with gaseous hydrogen. </li>
<li>Usually from 1 to 10% of the substance to be reduced is employed. In 'Industrial Chemistry' they state 0.5 to 1 percent catalyst is used. Merck's Index reads from 1 to 10 percent is used. Doctors- good, respectable, intelligent, capable medical men of unimpeachable integrity - recommend and advise that their patients who are in danger of or have had heart troubles, give up the use of butter and instead, use margarine. </li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Your Constitution (Your Ayurvedic Constitution) <br>
Food Charts Trees have life.</h2>
</p>
<li>According to ayurveda, every individual has unique needs for balance. Since diet is one of the most important Ayurvedic tools for achieving balance, Ayurvedic healers generally design individualized diets for people they see, based on various factors such as age and gender, the doshic tendencies that need to be balanced at a given time, the strength of the body tissues and the digestive fires, and the level of ama (toxins) in the body. </li>
<li>The place where a person lives and the season are also factors that affect dietary dos and don'ts. </li>
<li>Notwithstanding the individualized approach to choosing foods for balance, there are some universally applicable principles that are important to follow if you are living an Ayurvedic lifestyle: </li>
    </ul></p>
<p><ol>
<p><h2><b><li>Include the six tastes at every main meal. </li></h2></b> </p>
<ul><p>
<li>In ayurveda, foods are classified into six tastes--sweet, sour, salty, bitter, pungent and astringent. Ayurvedic healers recommend that you include all of these six tastes at each main meal you eat. Each taste has a balancing ability, and including some of each minimizes cravings and balances the appetite and digestion. </li>
<li>The general North American diet tends to have too much of the sweet, sour and salty, and not enough of the bitter, pungent and astringent tastes. </li>
<li>A fruit-spice chutney or a spice-mix can provide a little of each of the six tastes if you are in a hurry, but it is ideal to choose foods from each category for complete, balanced nutrition. </li>
<li>Just in the category of fresh vegetables and herbs, for example, you could choose fennel bulb or carrot for the sweet taste, fresh lemons for sour, arugula or endive for bitter, radish or white daikon or ginger root for pungent and cabbage or broccoli or cilantro for astringent. </li>
<li>The Amalaki Rasayana made from the Amla fruit, offers five of the six Ayurvedic tastes--all except salty. </li> 
</ul></p>
<p><h2><b><li>Choose foods by balancing physical attributes. </p></li></h2></b>  
<p><ul>

<li>In ayurveda, foods are also categorized as heavy or light, dry or unctuous/liquid and warm or cool (temperature), and different qualities balance different doshas. </li> 
<li>A balanced main meal should contain some foods of each physical type. Within this overall principle, you can vary the proportions of each type based on your constitution and needs for balance, the season of the year and the place you live. </li>
<li>To keep Vata dosha in balance, choose more heavy, unctuous or liquid, and warm foods, and fewer dry, light or cool foods. </li>
<li>To help balance Pitta, focus more on cool, dry and heavy foods, and to balance Kapha, try more of light, dry and warm foods. </li>
<li>If you live in cooler climes, you'll want to gravitate towards warm comfort foods, and vice versa. Similarly, in winter, when Vata dosha tends to increase in most people's constitutions, almost everyone can benefit from including warm soups and nourishing dhals, fresh paneer cheese and whole milk in the diet. In the summer, plan on eating more cool, soothing foods to help keep Pitta dosha in balance. </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2><b><li>Choose foods that are sattvic. </p></li></h2></b>  
<p><ul>
<li>A third ayurvedic classification of foods is by the effect they have on the non-physical aspects of the physiology--mind, heart, senses and spirit. </li>
<li>Sattvic foods have an uplifting yet stabilizing influence, rajasic foods stimulate and can aggravate some aspects of the mind, heart or senses, and tamasic foods breed lethargy and are considered a deterrent to spiritual growth. </li>
<li>Everyone, whether actively seeking spiritual growth or not, can benefit by including some sattvic foods at every meal because they help promote mental clarity, emotional serenity and sensual balance and aid in the coordinated functioning of the body, mind, heart, senses and spirit. </li>
<li>Almonds, rice, honey, fresh sweet fruits, mung beans and easy-to-digest, fresh seasonal vegetables and leafy greens are examples of sattvic foods. </li>
<li>To get the full sattwa from sattvic foods, prepare and eat them whole and fresh. </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2><b><li>Opt for whole, fresh, in-season, local foods. </p></li></h2></b>  
<p><ul>
<li>Authentic ayurvedic herbal preparations are made by processing the whole plant or the whole plant part, not by extracting active substances from the plant. </li>
<li>Similarly, from the ayurvedic perspective, the most healthful diet consists of whole foods, eaten in as natural a state as possible, the only exception being when removing a peel or cooking helps increase digestibility and assimilation for certain types of constitutions. If the digestive fire is not strong enough, even wholesome foods can turn into ama (toxic matter) in the body. </li>
<li>Foods that are frozen, canned, refined so as to denude the food of its nutritive value, processed with artificial colors, flavorings, additives or preservatives, genetically altered, or grown with chemical pesticides or fertilizers are not recommended by ayurvedic healers, because such foods are lacking in chetana--living intelligence--and prana--vital life-energy--and will do more harm than good in the physiology. </li>
<li>For the above reasons, it's best to choose foods and produce that is locally grown or produced, foods that are in-season, and foods that are organic, natural and whole. </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2><b><li>Rotate menus and experiment with a variety of foods. </p></li></h2></b>  
<p><ul>
<li>The sages that wrote the ancient ayurvedic texts would be horrified by our current fascination with the low-crab diet or the no-fat diet or the juice diet--from the ayurvedic perspective, any diet that is exclusive in nature is by definition incomplete in its nutritive value and ability to balance all aspects of the physiology. </li>
<li>Eat a wide variety of foods for balanced nutrition--whole grains, lentils and pulses, vegetables, fruits, dairy, nuts, healthy oil or ghee, spices and pure water all have their roles in the balancing process. </li>
<li>If you find yourself eating the same dishes several times a week, or you gravitate towards the same produce or foods every time you shop, resolve now to start making your meals an adventure. </li>
<li>Every week, try at least a few new foods or fix familiar foods in new ways, so that your taste buds and your digestion are constantly exposed to some new stimuli in addition to the familiar. </li>
<li>According to ayurveda, each meal should be a feast for all of your senses. When your plate reflects an appealing variety of colors, textures, flavors and aromas, your digestive juices start freely flowing in anticipation and your body, mind and heart are all fulfilled by the eating experience. </li>
</ul></p>
<p><h2><b><li> Include spices and herbs in your daily diet. </p></li></h2></b>  
<p><ul>
<li>Spices and herbs are concentrated forms of Nature's healing intelligence. They are particularly revered in ayurveda for their ability to enhance digestion and assimilation, help cleanse ama (toxins) from the body and their yogavahi property--their ability to transport the healing and nutritive value of other components of the diet to the cells, tissues and organs. </li>
<li>Spices, in ayurveda, are generally eaten cooked. Sauté spices in a little olive oil or ghee (clarified butter) and pour the mixture over cooked foods, or simmer spices with foods like beans or grains as they cook. Fresh herbs such as cilantro or mint are generally added at the end of the cooking process, just before serving. </li>
<li>Ayurveda recommends spices/herbs to stimulate the digestion before a meal, during a meal and after a meal. </li>
<li>Eating a bit of fresh ginger and lemon about 30 minutes before a main meal helps kick-start the digestion. Eating dishes cooked with a variety of spices and herbs helps the process of , </li>
</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Digestion</li>
<li>Absorption</li>
<li>Assimilation</li>
<li>Elimination </li>
</ol></p>
<p>
<li>Chewing fennel seeds after a meal helps digestion and freshens the breath naturally as well. </li>
<li>Ayurvedic rasayanas such as Amalaki and Triphala offer additional ways to help nourish and cleanse the digestive system. </li>
<li>Amalaki Rasayana helps enhance digestion, helps balance the production of stomach acid and nourishes the body tissues. </li>
<li>Triphala Rasayana helps tone and cleanses the digestive tract and helps nourish the different tissues. </li>
</ul></p>
